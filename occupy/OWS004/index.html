        <dd>Queering Occupy Wall Street were a caucus that centered queer lives, experiences, and queer-led direct action within Occupy Wall Street. This multi-page pamphlet was produced by Queering Occupy Wall Street as a way to share language, terms, and framing as a means of political education within Occupy Wall Street. The pamphlet introduces the reader to information related to gender sexuality; however, its authors uphold a queer politic of autonomy and resist strict defnition.</dd>
        
    
  
    

    

    
    
      
        <dt>Image Description</dt>
        
        <dd>Page one  of this pamphlet, designed in black font on a white page, says "Queering OWS Radical Language Road Guide" above a modified trans symbol with the letters QOWS (Queering Occupy Wall Street) in its center. Below the symbol, more text reads "The express purpose of this guide it education everyone about concepts and terms used in radical and queer community circles." Below this text are two QR codes, one for a Facebook page and the second which links to the General Assembly website.

Page two of this pamphlet, is the centerfold of the pamphlet. It is divided into three columns and includes a list of concepts and terms and their definitions written in black font on a white page. Concepts and terms that are included: transgender, cisgender, intersex, gender identity, gender expression, gender binary, preferred gender pronouns, gender nonconforming, gender questioning, gender queer, queer, heteronormativity (heteronormative), homonormativity (homonormative), assigned gender, asexual, sex positive, polyamory, multiple system (multiplicity), Two-Spirit. 

Page three offers a definition of what the Queering Occupy Wall Street  (QOWS) caucus means by "queering." At the top of the white page, written in black font, it reads "What Is 'Queering'?" Below QOWS provides the following definition: "The Queering of Occupy Wall Street (OWS) is the shining of a light on all aspects of communcal living and movement building. It means ensuring that members of our community do not feel invisible, undermined or neglected. It means introducing new language, new concepts, and more inclusive tactics that promote diversity and compassion. It means honoring and infusing our actions with love, beauty, and the entire collective fierceness of the Queer/LGBT communities. It means creating space within the movement for Queer/LGBT community members to come together, discuss issues that are important to them, and support each other through direct interaction and active support. It means pointing out acts of transphobia, homophobia, and sexism; to take a stand against these oppressive acts through visibility and open condemnation. It means sharing our history and sharing the tools needed to shift the paradigm, undermine the patriarchy, and unravel the heteronormative supremacy that is the root cause of all the problems with the current oligarchy."

Page four of this document provides a concluding disclaimer in black text on a white page. It reads: "Disclaimer. The information and descriptions included in this education document are loose guidelines for understanding important lanugage and successfully navigating within queer space. Each piece of information included in this document is circumstantial and should be regarded with some degree of fluidity to ensure inclusivity and understanding." Below this statement is a logo created by Queering Occupy that incorprates a transgender symbol as the "O" in Occupy and the use of an inverted triangle in the place of the "U" in "Occupy." At the bottom of the page is a link to the Queering Occupy Wall Street Twitter handle.</dd>
