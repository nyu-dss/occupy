        <dd>*Content Warning: This caption includes description of the state sanctioned murder of Black individuals in the United States* On February 26, 17-year-old Travyon Benjamin Martin was murdered by George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. Trayvon was murdered while wearing a hoodie and carrying a bag of Skittles candy -- both of which became symbols in the protests that were held leading up to Zimmerman's April 11th indictment on murder charges. On March 22, 2012, demonstrators from Occupy Wall Street were joined by Travyon Martin's family, including his mother Sabrina Fulton and father Tracy Martin, for the "Million Hoodie March" during which the protesters marched from Union Square, where protesters were seeking to set up a new encampment, to Times Square. During the march, Sabrina Fulton gave a speech saying "My son is your son." As an early example of social media activism, also called hashtag activism, a tactic used throughout the Occupy movement, the flyer for the protest invites demonstrators to post on social media with #millionhoodies. In July of 2013, following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi began the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, launching the international, decentralized Black Lives Matter movement. The flyer also calls for protestors to "Say No to Racial Profiling" and "Say No to Stop and Frisk," two major issues that the Occupy movement took up in response to NYPD's violent policing tactics of surveilling and harrassing Black and Brown communities. In this way, Occupy called attention to the overlapping and interconnected issues of  white supremacy, racialized violence, and policing in the United States.</dd>
