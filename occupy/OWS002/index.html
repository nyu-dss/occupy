        <dd>The largest student strike in Québec and Canada's historied occurred during 2012, lasting from February 12, 2012 through September 7, 2012. In what the media dubbed "the Maple Spring," students in Québec went on strike following the provincial government's increase of student tution by 75%. The goverment responded by enacting Bill 12, also called Billed 78, which pressured students to end their demonstrations by enacting provisions that forced students to return to their coursework and limited their rights to protest. Students in the United States took inspiration from the actions of the Québec student strike, and brought similar critiques about the corporatization of higher education, untenable tuitiion and fees, rising student debt, and the need for free education. Strikers and their supporters, would affix a small red square (attached to this card with a safety pin) to show their solidarity for the movement. The card makes note that every Wednesday evening is a casseroles protest and requests that protestors bring pots and pans "to make some noise!" Cacerolazo, also called caserolada or casserole is a form of protest popular around the world, though predominantly in South America, where protestors call attention to their cause, and create a sonic disturbance, by banging pots, pans, and utensils together. Noisemaking has a long tradition in protest, inclusive of the use of song, protest bands, and noise demos outside of carceral sites. The casserole invites wide participation as the noisemakers it requires are materials often easily found or borrowed.</dd>

        <dd>A small white card reads in black font, "INFINITE STRIKE // NYC SOLIDARITY WITH THE STUDENTS OF QUEBEC. Every Wednesday: Casseroles! 8pm -- Washington Square Park. Bring your pots and pans to make some noise! The students of Québec are currently facing threats on their educational system that would increase tuition by 75% over the next five years. As a response, the students of Québec have called for an INFINITE STRIKE, refusing to accept this new policy. Hundreds of students and supporters have taken the streets of Québec, for over 100 days now. On May 18th, The National Assembly of Québec passed an emergency law: Bill 78. The Law attempts to restrict freedom of assembly, protest, or picketing on or near university grounds, and anywhere in Québec. The law also places restrictions upon education employees right to strike. # NYC Infinite Strike will continue to march in solidarity with the strikers of Québec, while also working towards building a strong student movement here in the United States. Outstanding student loan debt in the United States has reached $1 Trillion, surpassing any other form of debt in America! We are in an education crisis, and it is vital that we stand up. We demand acessible education for every human being. Facebook & Twitter: NYC INFINITE STRIKE." Affixed to the card is a red square of fabric, held to the card by a safety pin.</dd>
