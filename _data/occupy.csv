On their still extant social media, Occupy on Wheels write, ""OOW (Occupy On Wheels) is dedicated to providing tips to organizers & activists on how the occupy movement (and protest events in general) can be more inclusive and accessible, and why this is important (and easy!)."" Occupy on Wheels held regular teach-ins on accessibility within social justice movements, and continued to support movement work, by creating and supporting new disability justice outreach projects throughout NYC, for several years following the end of Occupy.

Wagner Labor Archives, New York University",Unknown,"They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right","The largest student strike in Québec and Canada's historied occurred during 2012, lasting from February 12, 2012 through September 7, 2012. In what the media dubbed ""the Maple Spring,"" students in Québec went on strike following the provincial government's increase of student tution by 75%. The goverment responded by enacting Bill 12, also called Billed 78, which pressured students to end their demonstrations by enacting provisions that forced students to return to their coursework and limited their rights to protest. Students in the United States took inspiration from the actions of the Québec student strike, and brought similar critiques about the corporatization of higher education, untenable tuitiion and fees, rising student debt, and the need for free education. Strikers and their supporters, would affix a small red square (attached to this card with a safety pin) to show their solidarity for the movement. The card makes note that every Wednesday evening is a casseroles protest and requests that protestors bring pots and pans ""to make some noise!"" Cacerolazo, also called caserolada or casserole is a form of protest popular around the world, though predominantly in South America, where protestors call attention to their cause, and create a sonic disturbance, by banging pots, pans, and utensils together. Noisemaking has a long tradition in protest, inclusive of the use of song, protest bands, and noise demos outside of carceral sites. The casserole invites wide participation as the noisemakers it requires are materials often easily found or borrowed.

Image Description: A small white card reads in black font, ""INFINITE STRIKE // NYC SOLIDARITY WITH THE STUDENTS OF QUEBEC. Every Wednesday: Casseroles! 8pm -- Washington Square Park. Bring your pots and pans to make some noise! The students of Québec are currently facing threats on their educational system that would increase tuition by 75% over the next five years. As a response, the students of Québec have called for an INFINITE STRIKE, refusing to accept this new policy. Hundreds of students and supporters have taken the streets of Québec, for over 100 days now. On May 18th, The National Assembly of Québec passed an emergency law: Bill 78. The Law attempts to restrict freedom of assembly, protest, or picketing on or near university grounds, and anywhere in Québec. The law also places restrictions upon education employees right to strike. # NYC Infinite Strike will continue to march in solidarity with the strikers of Québec, while also working towards building a strong student movement here in the United States. Outstanding student loan debt in the United States has reached $1 Trillion, surpassing any other form of debt in America!  We are in an education crisis, and it is vital that we stand up.

Police abruptly declared the park closed at 11:30 PM, immediately moved into the park, and began brutalizing protestors with batons. Thought this flyer does not speak directly of her experience, it was during this six month anniversary gathering that Cecily McMillan was sexually assaulted, beaten, and arrested by NYPD. McMillian was ultimately charged with felony second-degree assault of a police officer. In a trial that was criticized as a miscarriage of justice, and became a rallying cry against the inequities of the justice system, McMillian was convicted of her charges, and was sentenced to three months in prison and five years of probation. She served fifty-eight days at Rikers Island. This flyer calls for an emergency response to the brutality that protestors faced on March 17, 2012. It is not only a document of the harrassment and violence that Occupy protestors faced at the hands of NYPD, but it demonstrates how fluidly, in a leaderful movement, protestors were able to organize themselves into action.

They moved into the park swinging batons, beating people attempting to exercize rights that are supposed to be legally guaranteed. The New York Times reported that scores were arrested.

It means introducing new language, new concepts, and more inclusive tactics that promote diversity and compassion. It means honoring and infusing our actions with love, beauty, and the entire collective fierceness of the Queer/LGBT communities. It means creating space within the movement for Queer/LGBT community members to come together, discuss issues that are important to them, and support each other through direct interaction and active support. It means pointing out acts of transphobia, homophobia, and sexism; to take a stand against these oppressive acts through visibility and open condemnation. It means sharing our history and sharing the tools needed to shift the paradigm, undermine the patriarchy, and unravel the heteronormative supremacy that is the root cause of all the problems with the current oligarchy.""

In this way, the flyer, in the form of a ""direct communication"" poses that the real and persisting  threat of Occupy to the status quo, to the police, and to the ruling elite, is the establishment of a ""self-contained functional community"" that does not rely on capitalist and carceral systems.
