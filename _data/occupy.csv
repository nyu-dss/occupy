In what the media dubbed ""the Maple Spring,"" students in Québec went on strike following the provincial government's increase of student tution by 75%. The goverment responded by enacting Bill 12, also called Billed 78, which pressured students to end their demonstrations by enacting provisions that forced students to return to their coursework and limited their rights to protest. Students in the United States took inspiration from the actions of the Québec student strike, and brought similar critiques about the corporatization of higher education, untenable tuitiion and fees, rising student debt, and the need for free education. Strikers and their supporters, would affix a small red square (attached to this card with a safety pin) to show their solidarity for the movement. The card makes note that every Wednesday evening is a casseroles protest and requests that protestors bring pots and pans ""to make some noise!"" Cacerolazo, also called caserolada or casserole is a form of protest popular around the world, though predominantly in South America, where protestors call attention to their cause, and create a sonic disturbance, by banging pots, pans, and utensils together. Noisemaking has a long tradition in protest, inclusive of the use of song, protest bands, and noise demos outside of carceral sites.

As a response, the students of Québec have called for an INFINITE STRIKE, refusing to accept this new policy. Hundreds of students and supporters have taken the streets of Québec, for over 100 days now. On May 18th, The National Assembly of Québec passed an emergency law: Bill 78. The Law attempts to restrict freedom of assembly, protest, or picketing on or near university grounds, and anywhere in Québec. The law also places restrictions upon education employees right to strike. # NYC Infinite Strike will continue to march in solidarity with the strikers of Québec, while also working towards building a strong student movement here in the United States.

Thought this flyer does not speak directly of her experience, it was during this six month anniversary gathering that Cecily McMillan was sexually assaulted, beaten, and arrested by NYPD. McMillian was ultimately charged with felony second-degree assault of a police officer. In a trial that was criticized as a miscarriage of justice, and became a rallying cry against the inequities of the justice system, McMillian was convicted of her charges, and was sentenced to three months in prison and five years of probation. She served fifty-eight days at Rikers Island. This flyer calls for an emergency response to the brutality that protestors faced on March 17, 2012.

It means introducing new language, new concepts, and more inclusive tactics that promote diversity and compassion. It means honoring and infusing our actions with love, beauty, and the entire collective fierceness of the Queer/LGBT communities. It means creating space within the movement for Queer/LGBT community members to come together, discuss issues that are important to them, and support each other through direct interaction and active support. It means pointing out acts of transphobia, homophobia, and sexism; to take a stand against these oppressive acts through visibility and open condemnation.

By 1 AM, the park was completely fenced off and no one was allowed beyond the police barricades. Emergency texts, tweets, and livestreamed recordings made their way througout the city's activitst networks: Occupy Wall Street was being evicted. Protesters quickly made their way downtown to defend  the park and those who resisted the cops were pepper sprayed, beaten, and arrested. In two short hours, much of the two month-long Occupy Wall Street encampment was destroyed. By 5 am, city sanitation dump trucks carried away the bulk of the encampment's infrastructure. Occupiers would later sue the city over its destruction of more than 3,000 books from the People's Library, computers -- which the city had ensured were recoverable, bicycles that were used to generate electricity, and more. In the following months, Occupy existed and persisted in a kind of exile, searching for a new home. More than 50 protesters, including clergy members, were arrested the following month during the D17 action to occupy Duarte Square and the ensuing march. This flyer discusses the Occupy movement after the eviction, noting that ""We occupied Zuccott Park as a provoation, but that became beside the point. Living together and building a community quickly captured our attention."" In this way, the flyer, in the form of a ""direct communication"" poses that the real and persisting  threat of Occupy to the status quo, to the police, and to the ruling elite, is the establishment of a ""self-contained functional community"" that does not rely on capitalist and carceral systems.

While this flowchart suggests a wholly egalitarian movement---that one could simply show up and ""Occupy Wall St. regulars will talk you through some workings of OWS, answer your questions, and help you plug into groups and projects--critiques of the movement's exclusion of people of color, in particular Black women organizers; LGBTQIA+ protestors; and disabled protestors are important to reckon with and confront.
