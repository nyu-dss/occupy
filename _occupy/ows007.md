description: "Whether it was because of the call for a jubilee on student debt or
  feeling drawn to other causes under the Occupy Wall Street movement, students from
  across New York City's colleges and unversities were a large presence in on-the-ground
  protests, working groups, and actions. Students at New York University formed an
  Occupy affinity group called NYU for Occupy Wall Street who coordinated student-led
  actions from, and in opposition to, the University. This included the occupation
  of university-owned buildings like the Stern School of Business on Gould Plaza and
  walk-outs like the one called for in this flyer. This walkout was a coordinated
  nation-wide effort that included student protests at more than 75 campuses across
  the country, much of which was organized through social media .\n\n"

The front page of the flyer provides details including the date and time (Wednesday, October 5th at 4pm) and contact information including an email address and a hashtag. The front of the flyer includes a raised fist carrying a torch, an emblem of NYU.

  Page 2  gives more context for the NYU student walkout. In black text on a yellow page, the flyer tells NYU students and workers to join the National Student Walkout, meeting "in the middle of Washington Square Park" to "march together to City Hall, where we'll join the Community/Labor March in Solidarity with Occupy Wall Street." The flyer notes that the march is endorsed by "unions and community groups including United Federation of Teachers, SEIU 32BJ and SEIU 1100, the Transit Workers Union Local 100, Make the Road New York, New Yorkers Against Budget Cuts, and Alliance for Quality Education."
