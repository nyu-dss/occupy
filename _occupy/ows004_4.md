description: |-
  Queering Occupy Wall Street were a caucus that centered queer lives, experiences, and queer-led direct action within Occupy Wall Street. This multi-page pamphlet was produced by Queering Occupy Wall Street as a way to share language, terms, and framing as a means of political education within Occupy Wall Street. The pamphlet introduces the reader to information related to gender sexuality; however, its authors uphold a queer politic of autonomy and resist strict defnition.

  Image Description: Page four (of four) of this document provides a concluding disclaimer in black text on a white page. It reads: "Disclaimer. The information and descriptions included in this education document are loose guidelines for understanding important lanugage and successfully navigating within queer space. Each piece of information included in this document is circumstantial and should be regarded with some degree of fluidity to ensure inclusivity and understanding." Below this statement is a logo created by Queering Occupy that incorprates a transgender symbol as the "O" in Occupy and the use of an inverted triangle in the place of the "U" in "Occupy." At the bottom of the page is a link to the Queering Occupy Wall Street Twitter handle.
themes: Grassroots Organizing and Mutual Aid; Inequality and Discriminiation
