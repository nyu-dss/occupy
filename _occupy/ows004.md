description: "Queering Occupy Wall Street were a caucus that centered queer lives,
  experiences, and queer-led direct action within Occupy Wall Street. This multi-page
  pamphlet was produced by Queering Occupy Wall Street as a way to share language,
  terms, and framing as a means of political education within Occupy Wall Street.
  The pamphlet introduces the reader to information related to gender sexuality; however,
  its authors uphold a queer politic of autonomy and resist strict defnition. \n\n"

  \"What Is 'Queering'?\" Below QOWS provides the following definition: \"The Queering
  of Occupy Wall Street (OWS) is the shining of a light on all aspects of communcal
  living and movement building. It means ensuring that members of our community do
  not feel invisible, undermined or neglected. It means introducing new language,
  new concepts, and more inclusive tactics that promote diversity and compassion.
  It means honoring and infusing our actions with love, beauty, and the entire collective
  fierceness of the Queer/LGBT communities. It means creating space within the movement
  for Queer/LGBT community members to come together, discuss issues that are important
  to them, and support each other through direct interaction and active support. It
  means pointing out acts of transphobia, homophobia, and sexism; to take a stand
  against these oppressive acts through visibility and open condemnation. It means
  sharing our history and sharing the tools needed to shift the paradigm, undermine
  the patriarchy, and unravel the heteronormative supremacy that is the root cause
  of all the problems with the current oligarchy.\"\n\nImage Description: Page four
  (of four) of this document provides a concluding disclaimer in black text on a white
  page. It reads: \"Disclaimer. The information and descriptions included in this
  education document are loose guidelines for understanding important lanugage and
  successfully navigating within queer space. Each piece of information included in
  this document is circumstantial and should be regarded with some degree of fluidity
  to ensure inclusivity and understanding.\" Below this statement is a logo created
  by Queering Occupy that incorprates a transgender symbol as the \"O\" in Occupy
  and the use of an inverted triangle in the place of the \"U\" in \"Occupy.\" At
  the bottom of the page is a link to the Queering Occupy Wall Street Twitter handle."
