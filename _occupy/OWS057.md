description: 'Sign promoting Occupy''s People''s Library, "These Stupid Hippies Want
  the 99 % to Read." The Library held a collection of more than 5,000 items in November
  2011, including a wide range of books and periodicals from multiple points of view.
  The American Library Association (ALA) stated that the library "reflected many of
  ALA’s core intellectual freedom values and best practices—a balanced, cataloged
  collection, representing diverse points of view, that included children’s books
  and reference service often provided by professional librarians." The NYPD seized
  the library in the early morning hours of November 15 during its raid of Zucotti
  Park. '
