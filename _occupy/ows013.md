description: '*Content Warning: This caption includes description of the state sanctioned
  murder of Black individuals in the United States* On February 26, 17-year-old Travyon
  Benjamin Martin was murdered by George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. Trayvon was
  murdered while wearing a hoodie and carrying a bag of Skittles candy -- both of
  which became symbols in the protests that were held leading up to Zimmerman''s April
  11th indictment on murder charges. On March 22, 2012, demonstrators from Occupy
  Wall Street were joined by Travyon Martin''s family, including his mother Sabrina
  Fulton and father Tracy Martin, for the "Million Hoodie March" during which the
  protesters marched from Union Square, where protesters were seeking to set up a
  new encampment, to Times Square. During the march, Sabrina Fulton gave a speech
  saying "My son is your son." As an early example of social media activism, also
  called hashtag activism, a tactic used throughout the Occupy movement, the flyer
  for the protest invites demonstrators to post on social media with #millionhoodies.
  In July of 2013, following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, Alicia Garza, Patrisse
  Cullors, and Opal Tometi began the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, launching the international,
  decentralized Black Lives Matter movement. The flyer also calls for protestors to
  "Say No to Racial Profiling" and "Say No to Stop and Frisk," two major issues that
  the Occupy movement took up in response to NYPD''s violent policing tactics of surveilling
  and harrassing Black and Brown communities. In this way, Occupy called attention
  to the overlapping and interconnected issues of  white supremacy, racialized violence,
  and policing in the United States. '
