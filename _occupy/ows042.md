description: Flyer for an "underwater mortgage rally." In the wake of the 2008 recession
  that led to approximately 10 million people losing their homes, Occupy sought to
  bring renewed attention to housing. After a period of widespread predatory lending
  and unregulated markets, the federal government did little to combat the growing
  housing crisis in the United States.
