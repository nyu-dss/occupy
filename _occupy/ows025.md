  seek relevant input, and then submit the proposal to faciliation. Following a review
  period, they would then get a confirmation of having a place on the agenda before
  presenting their proposal. The sheet includes a handwritten note that tells activists
  that "an emergency proposal must have an external deadline that was not previously
  knowable." The second page is a proposal form that individuals could drop off at
  the Info Desk or at the Facilitation Table at Liberty Plaza. '
