description: "Queering Occupy Wall Street were a caucus that centered queer lives,
  experiences, and queer-led direct action within Occupy Wall Street. This multi-page
  pamphlet was produced by Queering Occupy Wall Street as a way to share language,
  terms, and framing as a means of political education within Occupy Wall Street.
  The pamphlet introduces the reader to information related to gender sexuality; however,
  its authors uphold a queer politic of autonomy and resist strict defnition.\n\nImage
