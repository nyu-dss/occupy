description: "As a horizontal and leaderful movement, Occupy Wall Street invited wide
  partcipation. Individuals often independently produced documentation on how to participate
  in the movement. This unattributed flyer, produced during the post May Day \"Week
  of Actions Against Austerity,\" offers a flowchart to newcomers to the movement
  on how to participate. While this flowchart suggests a wholly egalitarian movement---that
  one could simply show up and \"Occupy Wall St. regulars will talk you through some
  workings of OWS, answer your questions, and help you plug into groups and projects--critiques
  of the movement's exclusion of people of color, in particular Black women organizers;
  LGBTQIA+ protestors; and disabled protestors are important to reckon with and confront.
  The entrenchment of societal oppressions was very real within the Occupy movement
  and was a barrier to participation for many. \n\n"
