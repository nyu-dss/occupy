  As a horizontal and leaderful movement, Occupy Wall Street invited wide partcipation. Individuals often independently produced documentation on how to participate in the movement. This unattributed flyer, produced during the post May Day "Week of Actions Against Austerity," offers a flowchart to newcomers to the movement on how to participate. While this flowchart suggests a wholly egalitarian movement---that one could simply show up and "Occupy Wall St. regulars will talk you through some workings of OWS, answer your questions, and help you plug into groups and projects--critiques of the movement's exclusion of people of color, in particular Black women organizers; LGBTQIA+ protestors; and disabled protestors are important to reckon with and confront. The entrenchment of societal oppressions was very real within the Occupy movement and was a barrier to participation for many.
