description: 'Page 1 of 4. In lieu of Occupy''s struggles to meet the "day-to-day
  operational needs of working groups and caucuses," the OWS Structure Group produced
  this proposal for future organizing during the fall of 2011. The "living document"
  sought to address logistical challenges without altering OWS non-hiearchical nature.
  Organizers identified challenges such as access, transparency, functionality, and
  decision making as part of a broader effort to maintain a leadersless structure
  during the occupation. '
