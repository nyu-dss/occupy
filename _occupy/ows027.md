description: Page 1 of 4. In lieu of Occupy's struggles to meet the "day-to-day operational
  needs of working groups and caucuses," the OWS Structure Group produced this proposal
  for future organizing during the fall of 2011. The "living document" sought to address
  logistical challenges without altering OWS non-hiearchical nature. Organizers identified
  challenges such as access, transparency, functionality, and decision making as part
  of a broader effort to maintain a leadersless structure during the occupation.
