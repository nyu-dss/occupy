description: |-
  Queering Occupy Wall Street were a caucus that centered queer lives, experiences, and queer-led direct action within Occupy Wall Street. This multi-page pamphlet was produced by Queering Occupy Wall Street as a way to share language, terms, and framing as a means of political education within Occupy Wall Street. The pamphlet introduces the reader to information related to gender sexuality; however, its authors uphold a queer politic of autonomy and resist strict defnition.

  Image Description: Page one (of four) of this pamphlet, designed in black font on a white page, says "Queering OWS Radical Language Road Guide" above a modified trans symbol with the letters QOWS (Queering Occupy Wall Street) in its center. Below the symbol, more text reads "The express purpose of this guide it education everyone about concepts and terms used in radical and queer community circles." Below this text are two QR codes, one for a Facebook page and the second which links to the General Assembly website.
themes: Grassroots Organizing and Mutual Aid; Inequality and Discriminiation
