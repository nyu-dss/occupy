  *Content Warning: This caption includes description of police brutality* Shortly after midnight on November 15th, police in riot gear took up strategic positions around Zucotti Park, and around 12:45, they began making dispersal orders via loudspeaker. By 1 AM, the park was completely fenced off and no one was allowed beyond the police barricades. Emergency texts, tweets, and livestreamed recordings made their way througout the city's activitst networks: Occupy Wall Street was being evicted. Protesters quickly made their way downtown to defend  the park and those who resisted the cops were pepper sprayed, beaten, and arrested. In two short hours, much of the two month-long Occupy Wall Street encampment was destroyed. By 5 am, city sanitation dump trucks carried away the bulk of the encampment's infrastructure. Occupiers would later sue the city over its destruction of more than 3,000 books from the People's Library, computers -- which the city had ensured were recoverable, bicycles that were used to generate electricity, and more. In the following months, Occupy existed and persisted in a kind of exile, searching for a new home. More than 50 protesters, including clergy members, were arrested the following month during the D17 action to occupy Duarte Square and the ensuing march. This flyer discusses the Occupy movement after the eviction, noting that "We occupied Zuccott Park as a provoation, but that became beside the point. Living together and building a community quickly captured our attention." In this way, the flyer, in the form of a "direct communication" poses that the real and persisting  threat of Occupy to the status quo, to the police, and to the ruling elite, is the establishment of a "self-contained functional community" that does not rely on capitalist and carceral systems.

  This is a two-sided flier of white text on a black background. The flier provides texts that notes "We are not trying to return to Zuccotti Park" and instead offers lessons, strategy, and ideas learned in the first two months of the Occupy Wall Street encampment, resisting the police state, and suggests "how to undo this mess." The flier incorporates imagery of bodies including the outline of a human form in white; a head, in profile, in black; a body with its arms reaching upwards; and two raised fists that are shackled by handcuffs.
