description: |
  Queering Occupy Wall Street were a caucus that centered queer lives, experiences, and queer-led direct action within Occupy Wall Street. This multi-page pamphlet was produced by Queering Occupy Wall Street as a way to share language, terms, and framing as a means of political education within Occupy Wall Street. The pamphlet introduces the reader to information related to gender sexuality; however, its authors uphold a queer politic of autonomy and resist strict defnition.

  Image Description: Page three (of four) offers a definition of what the Queering Occupy Wall Street  (QOWS) caucus means by "queering." At the top of the white page, written in black font, it reads "What Is 'Queering'?" Below QOWS provides the following definition: "The Queering of Occupy Wall Street (OWS) is the shining of a light on all aspects of communcal living and movement building. It means ensuring that members of our community do not feel invisible, undermined or neglected. It means introducing new language, new concepts, and more inclusive tactics that promote diversity and compassion. It means honoring and infusing our actions with love, beauty, and the entire collective fierceness of the Queer/LGBT communities. It means creating space within the movement for Queer/LGBT community members to come together, discuss issues that are important to them, and support each other through direct interaction and active support. It means pointing out acts of transphobia, homophobia, and sexism; to take a stand against these oppressive acts through visibility and open condemnation. It means sharing our history and sharing the tools needed to shift the paradigm, undermine the patriarchy, and unravel the heteronormative supremacy that is the root cause of all the problems with the current oligarchy."
themes: Grassroots Organizing and Mutual Aid; Inequality and Discriminiation
