  *Content Warning: This caption includes description of police brutality and sexual assault.* On the six month anniversary of Occupy, hundreds of protestors gathered in Zuccotti Park. Police abruptly declared the park closed at 11:30 PM, immediately moved into the park, and began brutalizing protestors with batons. Thought this flyer does not speak directly of her experience, it was during this six month anniversary gathering that Cecily McMillan was sexually assaulted, beaten, and arrested by NYPD. McMillian was ultimately charged with felony second-degree assault of a police officer. In a trial that was criticized as a miscarriage of justice, and became a rallying cry against the inequities of the justice system, McMillian was convicted of her charges, and was sentenced to three months in prison and five years of probation. She served fifty-eight days at Rikers Island. This flyer calls for an emergency response to the brutality that protestors faced on March 17, 2012. It is not only a document of the harrassment and violence that Occupy protestors faced at the hands of NYPD, but it demonstrates how fluidly, in a leaderful movement, protestors were able to organize themselves into action.

  Image description, black text on a bright green 8.5x11 piece of paper reads "Emergency Meeting in Response to Saturday Night NYPD Brutalization of People in Zuccotti Park. Today, Sunday, 2pm. In the Courtyard, B-Level (entrance on Spruce Stree). As hundreds of people joyously celebrated the six month birthday of Occupy Wall Street in Zuccotti Park, the largest gathering in months without police barricades, the NYPD declared the park closed at 11:30 pm. They moved into the park swinging batons, beating people attempting to exercize rights that are supposed to be legally guaranteed. The New York Times reported that scores were arrested. Calling out thousands from the millions that have been inspired and had their imagination captured by Occupy to stop the nationwide suppression is essential to going forward with all the differend plans of Occupy. Discuss how to carry through with 'A call for Mass Action Against the Suppression of the Occupy Movement,' 'The repression of the Occupy Movement must not stand. Act.'"
