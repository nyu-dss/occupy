  The cover features dozens of slogans from the OWS movement and the US left of the
  early-2010s such as \"People Before Profit,\" \"Loansharks Ate My World,\" and \"The
  Crisis is Capitalism.\" The cover attempts to bring together some of the logos and
  phrases that were a part of Occupy's sign culture at Zucotti and across the country.\n\nThe
  Occupied Wall Street Journal was just one of many independent publications and websites
  that were created during the fall of 2011. A new generation of left media emerged
  in the wake of Occupy. "
