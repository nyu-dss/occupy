description: A handout labeled "How to get a Proposal to the General Assembly or Spokes
  Council." Participants were encouraged to develop a proposal, seek relevant input,
  and then submit the proposal to faciliation. Following a review period, they would
  then get a confirmation of having a place on the agenda before presenting their
  proposal. The sheet includes a handwritten note that reads "an emergency proposal
  must have an external deadline that was not previously knowable." Page 1 of 2.
