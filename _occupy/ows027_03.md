description: 'In lieu of Occupy''s struggles to meet the "day-to-day operational needs
  of working groups and caucuses," the OWS Structure Group produced this proposal
  for future organizing during the fall of 2011. The "living document" sought to address
  logistical challenges without altering OWS non-hiearchical nature. Challenges identified
  include access, transparency, functionality, and decision making. '
