description: The Occupier was one of many periodicals that was launched during Occupy
  Wall Street, and is an example of the various forms of grassroots media that circulated
  about and by OWS during the height of the movement. The Occupier was produced by
  Organizing for Occupation, O4O, who primarily focused on issues of housing rights,
  foreclosure, and evictions -- some of the chief concerns of Occupy Wall Street in
  response to the widespread foreclosures in the United States, primarily between
  2007-2010, also known as the foreclosure crisis. The foreclosure crisis, also known
  as the subprime mortgage crisis, in which banks seized properties following years
  of predatory lending, was compounded by the Great Recession of 2008. Both of these
  events gave rise to the Occupy movement.

image_description: 'A two-paged newsletter called "The Occupier," authored by Organizing
  for Occupation, offers four articles: one describing the nature of Organizing for
  Occupation and what they hope to achieve, one amplifying the success of blocking
  the eviction of Mary Lee Ward, a third that describes the process of foreclosure
  and demanding a foreclosure moratorium, and a fourth that describes a wheel of participation
  inviting many different opportunities to join the group. Contact information and
  a meeting place are provided on the second page.'
