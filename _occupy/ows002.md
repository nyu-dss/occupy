description: "The largest student strike in Québec and Canada's historied occurred
  during 2012, lasting from February 12, 2012 through September 7, 2012. In what the
  media dubbed \"the Maple Spring,\" students in Québec went on strike following the
  provincial government's increase of student tution by 75%. The goverment responded
  by enacting Bill 12, also called Billed 78, which pressured students to end their
  demonstrations by enacting provisions that forced students to return to their coursework
  and limited their rights to protest. Students in the United States took inspiration
  from the actions of the Québec student strike, and brought similar critiques about
  the corporatization of higher education, untenable tuitiion and fees, rising student
  debt, and the need for free education. Strikers and their supporters, would affix
  a small red square (attached to this card with a safety pin) to show their solidarity
  for the movement. The card makes note that every Wednesday evening is a casseroles
  protest and requests that protestors bring pots and pans \"to make some noise!\"
  Cacerolazo, also called caserolada or casserole is a form of protest popular around
  the world, though predominantly in South America, where protestors call attention
  to their cause, and create a sonic disturbance, by banging pots, pans, and utensils
  together. Noisemaking has a long tradition in protest, inclusive of the use of song,
  protest bands, and noise demos outside of carceral sites. The casserole invites
  wide participation as the noisemakers it requires are materials often easily found
  or borrowed. \n"

image_description: 'A small white card reads in black font, "INFINITE STRIKE // NYC
  SOLIDARITY WITH THE STUDENTS OF QUEBEC. Every Wednesday: Casseroles! 8pm -- Washington
  Square Park. Bring your pots and pans to make some noise! The students of Québec
  are currently facing threats on their educational system that would increase tuition
  by 75% over the next five years. As a response, the students of Québec have called
  for an INFINITE STRIKE, refusing to accept this new policy. Hundreds of students
  and supporters have taken the streets of Québec, for over 100 days now. On May 18th,
  The National Assembly of Québec passed an emergency law: Bill 78. The Law attempts
  to restrict freedom of assembly, protest, or picketing on or near university grounds,
  and anywhere in Québec. The law also places restrictions upon education employees
  right to strike. # NYC Infinite Strike will continue to march in solidarity with
  the strikers of Québec, while also working towards building a strong student movement
  here in the United States. Outstanding student loan debt in the United States has
  reached $1 Trillion, surpassing any other form of debt in America! We are in an
  education crisis, and it is vital that we stand up. We demand acessible education
  for every human being. Facebook & Twitter: NYC INFINITE STRIKE." Affixed to the
  card is a red square of fabric, held to the card by a safety pin.'
