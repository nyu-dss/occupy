<h3 id="introduction"><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>In the winter and spring of 2011, waves of unrest coursed through Tunisia, Algeria, Lebanon, Jordan, Mauritania, Oman, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt. In the United States, protestors took over the Wisconsin State Capitol in Madison, rallying against the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill which decimated collective bargaining rights in the state. That summer unrest unfolded in Chile, Columbia, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, and Spain. The Spanish uprising, encampments in public squares of activists calling themselves Los Indignados, “the indignants,” became the May 15 or M15 movement whose strategies and rhetoric had a significant impact on the shape of what was to become Occupy.</p>

<p>As revolution circled the globe, <em>Adbusters</em>, a Canadian anti-consumerist magazine, published a call: “Are you ready for a Tahrir moment? On September 17, flood into lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades, and occupy Wall Street.” A core group of activists in New York—who were watching, learning, and even participating in these global movements—began meeting in New York City, calling themselves the New York City General Assembly (NYCGA). Together they planned their action. Eight sites fulfilled the needs identified by the Tactical Committee, a working group within NYCGA, and on Saturday, September 17th, a crowd of around 1,000 people gathered in lower Manhattan, with maps of possible targets on hand. Finding Chase Plaza already barricaded by the NYPD, the activists moved to “Location Two,” and by 3:00 PM, Occupy was hosting its first movement-wide General Assembly in its new home: Zuccotti Park.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Occupy’s encampment was violently destroyed by the NYPD and the City of New York after three months of maintaining a twenty-four hour, seven-days-a-week protest and takeover of the park. The movement carried on, and made attempts to take-over other sites, for another year; however, after thousands of brutal arrests, Occupy activists began to burn out after 2012. For some time after 2012, annual protests continued each year on the anniversary of September 17th and on May Day, but direct action, under the banner of Occupy, ceased altogether in 2015. Since then, any lasting contours of the movement have largely been appropriated by liberal causes. Nonetheless, the last ten years of left protest have made it hard to dismiss the importance of what transpired in lower Manhattan from 2011-2012.</p>

<p>On the 10th anniversary of the movement, this digital exhibit, <strong>No Turning Back: Ten Years After Occupy,</strong> brings together materials from across the Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives to examine that first, critical year of Occupy Wall Street. We have chosen archival materials that not only capture much of its aesthetics and rhetoric of the movement, but also seek to show how the protests became a national phenomenon that was a key turning point for left movements.</p>

<p>The exhibit is organized around the <em>Declaration of the Occupation of New York City</em>, a collectively authored letter to the world, drafted by the Call to Action Working Group and ratified by NYCGA, naming why these protestors were reclaiming public space in the name of the 99%. As a central and defining text of the movement, we wanted the <em>Declaration</em> to lead our exhibit’s structure—and, in doing so, allow Occupy Wall Street to speak to its own history. We also offer thirteen issues, presented here as exhibit themes, around which the protestors coalesced. These themes represent how Occupy centered itself as an anti-capitalist movement, brought renewed attention to economic inequality and corruption on Wall Street, and created a broad umbrella for a wide range of intersecting social movements. Analysis of the themes also demonstrates the ways in which Occupy Wall Street faced its own internal struggles from debates on tactics to its failure to address issues of race, gender, and accessibility within the movement.</p>

<p><strong>No Turning Back</strong> does not seek to be comprehensive in its content or analysis. It does not, for example, address the mass arrest of protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge on October 1, 2011,a moment which significantly galvanized Occupy, nor does it speak to Occupy’s mutual aid efforts following superstorm Sandy in 2012—arguably one of Occupy’s most effective actions. We worked primarily with the Occupy Wall Street Archives Working Group’s (OWS AWG) records: a collection which was built by the protesters themselves, to document their own movement. In this way, the collection is a reflection of what OWS AWG both wanted to communicate about itself and was able to document in the moment. To collect everything would have been an impossibility and, therefore, it is that impossibility for this exhibit to tell the whole story of Occupy. This means that there are sometimes noticeable gaps in the record, which we acknowledge. We nevertheless aimed to provide a representative cross-section of Occupy’s making of its own history.</p>

<p>By illuminating all that Occupy fought for and where it faltered, <strong>No Turning Back: Ten Years After Occupy,</strong> provides a retrospective for understanding where we are in 2021—politically fractured, burdened by the ravages of capitalism, white nationalist fascism rising, climate change reaching its critical tipping point, and trying to survive a pandemic. It also reminds us of the power of collective action and interdependence.</p>
