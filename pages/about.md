### Who we are

__Janet Bunde__ is the University Archivist in NYU Special Collections.

### Why we’re doing this

We created this exhibition to highlight resources about Black Solidarity Day and provide broad access to them while our collections remain largely closed. We hope that this exhibition provides a space for learning, reflection, and inspiration for viewers.

Materials in this exhibition come from collections held by NYU Special Collections, as well as materials contributed by community members, activists, and organizers of Black Solidarity Day celebrations across New York City and beyond. We encourage you to submit materials you have for inclusion in the exhibition. For more, see the "Contribute" section of our [Get Involved]({{ '/get-involved' | absolute_url }}) page.
