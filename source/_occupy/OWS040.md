description: 'A white cloth patch with black ink that reads "No justice, no peace.
  End stop and frisk! #occupywallstreet." 2011 was the height of stop-and-frisk as
  nearly 700,000 were stopped by the NYPD. Multiple studies have shown that people
  of color were stopped and interrogated at a significantly greater rate than white
  people in New York City. '
