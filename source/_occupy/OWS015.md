  This statement, titled "OWS Must Resist Cis-Supremacy and Trans Misogyny," and signed
  by "a bunch of trans women occupiers," calls for accountability within Occupy Wall
  Street after trans-exclusionary feminist groups, Women Occupying Nations and Strong
  Women, were given a platform at the General Assembly. This statement, which was
  first circulated online and was later printed as a flyer to be distributed in-person,
  appears to have been released following the November 9th General Assembly, during
  which members from the Queering OWS Caucus were disrupted by Women Occupying Nations
  while speaking out about issues of sexual assault and racism within the movement.
  The statement reminds readers that the "elimination of systemic oppression against
  marginalized people is a core goal of the Occupy movement" and calls for trans-exclusionary
  groups to be blocked from participation in the New York General Assembly. Citing
  their significant contributions to the movement, including the "creation and operation
  of OccupyWallSt.org," the signers note that they "are prepared to leave the New
  York General Assembly and its empowered Spokes Council en masse if trans-excluding
  groups, spaces, and individuals continue to be tolerated by this body" and demand
  the adoption of a trans-inclusive safer spaces policy. Following the release of
  this statement, in December 2011, activist, artists, and filmmaker wrote "An Open
  Letter for Gender Self-Determination in/at OWS" in the first issue of Post Post
  Script, a publication which circulated during Occupy Wall Street. Tourmaline states,
  "As long as there has been trans leadership, particularly trans women leadership,
  in movements for self determination, we have faced resistance and ejection from
  the very movements we have helped to make." Tourmaline reminds the reader that Occupy
  Wall Street is repeating the harms of the 1973 Washington Square Rally, during which
  organizers allowed Lesbian Feminist Liberation to remove Sylvia Rivera, a transwoman
  activist, from speaking. Tourmaline loses her note by saying "I want to remind each
  other with love that an investment in biologically determined gender is an investment
  in identities that were violently imposed on our bodies in order to maintain capitalism,
  white supremacy, and colonialism. That is why it is no good enough to just have
  non-trans queer women/gender queer people and trans men in these spaces and claim
  them as trans affirming. That is why it is not OK to non-consensually gender other
  people. That is why we must support the leadership of those who have faced historical
  exile and isolation from feminist and queer space. And that is the reason why being
  trans, gender-non-conforming, and queer are anti-capitalist acts." '
