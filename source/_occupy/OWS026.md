description: 'Handout that asks "Is This Tent Being Occupied" and by "How Many People?"  The
  OWS Town Planning group was interested in counting how many people were camping
  overnight at Zucotti Park in order to "improve the space for all of us." This sheet
  was taped to the front of tents inside of Zucotti Park. Keeping occupiers safe became
  an increasing concern for organizers as the camp grew in October and November.  '
