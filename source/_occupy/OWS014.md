description: 'Participants in the Occupy Wall Street movement often used humor to
  express their demands and to communicate widely. In this example, a protestor has
  altered an MTA change of service notice, which originally states that the Staten
  Island Express will not stop at Rector Street due to "Demonstrators." A protestor
  took it upon themselves to clarify that their demonstration is a "Protest Against
  Capitalism & Other Attrocities & NYPD." Dated October, 2011, this document is one
  of the earliest examples in the Occupy Wall Street collections that demonstrates
  how protestors connected the violence of capitalism with the violence of the NYPD. '
