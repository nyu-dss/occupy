  referencing the protests against Act 10 at the Wisconsin State Capitol that took
  place from February to June 2011. Introduced by Republican Governor Scott Walker,
  Act 10 placed severe limitations on collective bargaining rights for the state's
  public sector employees and made drastic cuts to their benefits. The law also made
  it illegal for employers to collect union dues from paychecks, even with a workers
  consent. Wisconsinâ€™s public sector unions have lost about 70 percent of their members
  since 2011. Activists were able to initiate a recall election in 2012, but Walker
  defeated the Democratic nomiee Tom Barrett. The Obama administration did little
  to support Wisconsin activists or Barrett's campaign in 2011/2012. Walker later
  signed a right-to-work law in 2015, further weakening the influence of unions in
  the state. \n\nThe protests at the Capitol involved tens of thousands of people
  and garnered much attention in labor and left media throughout 2011. Public sector
  workers and other acitivists sought to link their struggle to a long history of
  bipartisan attacks on unions, particularly since the 1980s. The occupation of the
  Capitol is now often seen as a precursor to Occupy Wall Street and new economic
  justice movements. "
