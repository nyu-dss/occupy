description: "Collective Agreement for Occupy's Office Space at 50 Broadway, the United
  Federation of Teacher's headquarters in lower Manhattan. The agreement was written
  by the Occupied Office Coordinator Team and it lists a few guidelines for their
  indoor space. \n\nUsing the logo of the television show The Office, the document
  asks organizers to \"respect each other and our hosts/allies at the UFT.\" It tells
  activists that the space cannot be used for sleeping or personal storage, and  also
  warns that there is zero tolerance for violence, drugs, and abuse of shared property.
  Violating these rules would result in a 30-day suspension from the building, and
  an eventual review of an individual's standing with the office. "
