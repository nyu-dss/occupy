description: "In response to the austerity measures put in place by the Spanish government,
  a deepening fiscal crisis in the central Spanish government, the 15-M, or Los Indignados,
  movement was formed. Los Indignados, an anti-austerity movement who coalesced around
  a slogan that translated in English as \"no house, no job, no pension, no fear,\"
  pushed against their precarity in housing, healthcare, education, employment, and
  pensions. As a global movement, Occupy Wall Street not only blossomed across nearly
  every continent, but it sought and found inspiration in youth-led, self-organized
  resistance around the world, inclusive of the 15-M movement. Signs announcing, \"Somos
  Los Indignandos,\" or \"We Are Los Indignados (the Indignants)\" were common at
  Occupy Wall Street. \n"
