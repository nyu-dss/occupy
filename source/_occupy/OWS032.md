description: "*Content Warning: This caption includes description of the state sanctioned
  murder of Black individuals in the United States.* Flyer for two protests in honor
  of Ramarly Graham that were held just before his funeral in the Bronx on February
  14. Graham was killed by a New York police officer who stormed into his grandmother's
  apartment and shot him in the chest. The flyer informs readers that Graham was unarmed
  and the police did not have a warrant to enter his family's home. Officers spotted
  Graham at a bodega near his home and thought he was carrying a gun because he adjusted
  his waistband. Officers reported that he to his grandmother's apartment after they
  talked to him, but surveillance footage showed that he walked calmly to the residential
  building."
