1,Anti-Imperialism and Anti-War,"Occupy evolved on the heels of the Bush-era anti-war movement. As one example of the intersection of the two movements, on the 10th anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, Occupy and anti-war protestors converged on Washington D.C. As the Obama administration continued many of Bush's policies in Afghanistan and Iraq, themes of anti-imperialism and anti-war were not uncommon at Occupy Wall Street."
2,Government Surveillance,"At the same time that Occupy Wall Street protestors faced surveillance by the FBI, NYPD, and the Department of Homeland Security, protestors also called attention to the efforts of whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning, who leaked classified military and diplomatic records. In this way, while Occupy Wall Street experienced suppression by government agents, those same activists fought back and found inspiration in acts of resistance against government, military, and police secrecy."
3,Environmentalism,"The Occupy Wall Street movement affiliated itself with environmental activism on a number of issues related to climate change and environmental degradation. In particular, the two movements coalesced around the Keystone XL Pipeline as protestors found common ground in the understanding that governments, corporate greed, and the ultra-wealthy place profits above people and the environment."
4,Grassroots Organizing and Mutual Aid,"From autonomous direct actions to sheltering and feeding thousands of protestors to re-building communities in the wake of superstorm Sandy, Occupy was a movement that relied upon non-hierarchical, people-led (not institutional-, organizational-, or non-profit-led), collective action. "
5,Independent Media,"Independent media was core to on-the-ground communications at Occupy, and protestors circulated information through a variety of means including newsletters, pamphlets, and a newspaper—the Occupied Wall Street Journal. Mainstream media coverage of the movement was often inaccurate or disparaging, and protestors seized the opportunity to create their own content and communicate their own narratives. "
6,Inequality and Discrimination,"While Occupy decried police brutality, fought against the ballooning housing crisis, and named and confronted economic inequalities—in particular, policies that negatively impacted the poor—the movement faced its own internal struggles against systemic oppression. Though many of the activists embraced anti-oppressive values, and were actively engaged in dismantling power imbalances, the movement itself perpetuated status-quo structures of oppression. In spite of Occupy's commitment to non-hierarchical organizing, preexisting societal notions of white, cis, abled, male normativity created fractures in the movement, and the persistence of these harms most impacted people of color, women, trans, non-binary, and disabled activists. "
7,Organized Labor,"Occupy Wall Street brought increased attention to labor issues in 2011-2012 through its focus on economic inequality. By shining a light on the plight of low-wage workers and pushing for a higher minimum wage, Occupy drew attention to the concerns of the non-unionized working class in the United States. NYC fastfood workers staged a publicized walk-out in the fall of 2012 that was replicated in other communities over the next few years. The initial action was organized by New York Communities for Change, an early supporter of the Occupy protests. The subsequent rise of the Fight for 15 movement, and increased coverage of service-sector workers, further expanded Occupy's push for a more robust labor movement. "
8,Organized Labor—Power of Unions,"After a decades-long decline in union membership, Occupy Wall Street was one of several events in the 21st century that spurred a renewed interest in unions, particularly among young people on the left. By October 2011, Occupy had garnered enough attention to receive significant support from labor unions, including those that typically avoided confrontational tactics. “Our members have been trying to have this discussion about Wall Street and the economy for a long time,” then AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in an interview. “This movement is providing us the vehicle.” Aside from the presence of union members at Zuccotti, influential labor unions provided office space, meeting rooms, photocopying services, legal help, and food to demonstrators. The partnership also led to activists participating in union actions, including a protest organized by telephone workers that was aimed at Verizon's abusive practices. The tenuous alliance was reflective of their shared frustrations with the Obama administration's lack of support for organized labor."
9,"Policing, Police Brutality,  and the Prison Industrial Complex","Occupy originally focused on economic inequality, but issues surrounding police brutality and the prison industrial complex were quickly incorporated into the movement's priorities. Police brutality became an even more pressing issue for activists following a series of brutal attacks from the NYPD in the fall of 2011. Demonstrators developed connections with other community groups who opposed the NYPD's racial profiling and military-style tactics, and they soon expanded their critique of policing to the American prison system."
10,Political and Financial Corruption,"Gathering in the middle of New York City's financial district, Occupy Wall Street demonstrators pushed the American public to learn more about the scale of political and financial corruption that led to the 2008/2009 recession. ""Banks got bailed out, we got sold out!"" was a common refrain at Occupy, as protesters echoed the lingering frustrations of Americans who felt that the CEOs, who were responsible for the fraud that led to the financial collapse, were not held accountable for their actions. 
"
11,Wealth Disparity,"""We are the 99 percent"" became the iconic slogan of the movement, as Occupy Wall Street played an important role in elevating the issue of wealth disparity into the mainstream discourse. Between 1979 and 2007, the top 1 percent of households secured 59.9 percent of all gains in income, while the bottom 90 percent only received 8.6 percent. After decades of redistributive policies that directly benefitted the rich, working class Americans were increasingly questioning their future place within the American capitalist system.  "
12,Wealth Disparity—Housing,"Housing rights was one of the primary concerns of Occupy Wall Street in response to the foreclosure crisis. The crisis, in which banks increasingly seized properties following years of predatory lending, was compounded by the Great Recession of 2008. As a result, 10 million people lost their homes between 2007-2010. After a period of widespread predatory lending and unregulated markets, the federal government did little to combat the growing housing crisis in the United States during the 2010s."
13,Wealth Disparity—Student Debt,"Student activists were at the forefront of the Occupy movement. As part of Occupy's broader effort to highlight economic inequality, activists were encouraged to share their personal stories of debt during the fall of 2011. Occupy demonstrators, and supporters across the country, launched an online campaign. Using social media, individuals held handwritten signs divulging the total amount they owed for their student loans. The protests sparked a new movement that has continued to call for universal student debt cancellation, and initiatives like the Rolling Jubilee Fund."
