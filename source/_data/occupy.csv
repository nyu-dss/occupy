The goverment responded by enacting Bill 12, also called Billed 78, which pressured students to end their demonstrations by enacting provisions that forced students to return to their coursework and limited their rights to protest. Students in the United States took inspiration from the actions of the Québec student strike, and brought similar critiques about the corporatization of higher education, untenable tuitiion and fees, rising student debt, and the need for free education.

By 1 AM, the park was completely fenced off and no one was allowed beyond the police barricades. Emergency texts, tweets, and livestreamed recordings made their way througout the city's activitst networks: Occupy Wall Street was being evicted. Protesters quickly made their way downtown to defend  the park and those who resisted the cops were pepper sprayed, beaten, and arrested. In two short hours, much of the two month-long Occupy Wall Street encampment was destroyed. By 5 am, city sanitation dump trucks carried away the bulk of the encampment's infrastructure. Occupiers would later sue the city over its destruction of more than 3,000 books from the People's Library, computers -- which the city had ensured were recoverable, bicycles that were used to generate electricity, and more. In the following months, Occupy existed and persisted in a kind of exile, searching for a new home. More than 50 protesters, including clergy members, were arrested the following month during the D17 action to occupy Duarte Square and the ensuing march. This flyer discusses the Occupy movement after the eviction, noting that ""We occupied Zuccott Park as a provoation, but that became beside the point. Living together and building a community quickly captured our attention."" In this way, the flyer, in the form of a ""direct communication"" poses that the real and persisting  threat of Occupy to the status quo, to the police, and to the ruling elite, is the establishment of a ""self-contained functional community"" that does not rely on capitalist and carceral systems.

Trayvon was murdered while wearing a hoodie and carrying a bag of Skittles candy -- both of which became symbols in the protests that were held leading up to Zimmerman's April 11th indictment on murder charges. On March 22, 2012, demonstrators from Occupy Wall Street were joined by Travyon Martin's family, including his mother Sabrina Fulton and father Tracy Martin, for the ""Million Hoodie March"" during which the protesters marched from Union Square, where protesters were seeking to set up a new encampment, to Times Square. During the march, Sabrina Fulton gave a speech saying ""My son is your son."" As an early example of social media activism, also called hashtag activism, a tactic used throughout the Occupy movement, the flyer for the protest invites demonstrators to post on social media with #millionhoodies. In July of 2013, following the acquittal of George Zimmerman, Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi began the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter, launching the international, decentralized Black Lives Matter movement. The flyer also calls for protestors to ""Say No to Racial Profiling"" and ""Say No to Stop and Frisk,"" two major issues that the Occupy movement took up in response to NYPD's violent policing tactics of surveilling and harrassing Black and Brown communities. In this way, Occupy called attention to the overlapping and interconnected issues of  white supremacy, racialized violence, and policing in the United States.

The law also made it illegal for employers to collect union dues from paychecks, even with a workers consent. Wisconsin’s public sector unions have lost about 70 percent of their members since 2011. Activists were able to initiate a recall election in 2012, but Walker defeated the Democratic nomiee Tom Barrett. The Obama administration did little to support Wisconsin activists or Barrett's campaign in 2011/2012.

The protests at the Capitol involved tens of thousands of people and garnered much attention in labor and left media throughout 2011. Public sector workers and other acitivists sought to link their struggle to a long history of bipartisan attacks on unions, particularly since the 1980s.

Kim was a welder who received international attention when she staged a protest against her employer on top of a 115-foot shipyard crane in 2011. Following massive layoffs, Kim occupied the crane for more than 300 days in order to pressure Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction to rehire unionists who had lost their jobs. The protest worked and nearly a hundred workers regained their positions as a result of Kim's protest and the movement she inspired across South Korea.
