In what the media dubbed ""the Maple Spring,"" students in Québec went on strike following the provincial government's increase of student tuition by 75%. The government responded by enacting Bill 12, also called Bill 78, which pressured students to end their demonstrations by enacting provisions that forced students to return to their coursework and limited their rights to protest. Students in the United States took inspiration from the actions of the Québec student strike, and brought similar critiques about the corporatization of higher education, untenable tuition and fees, rising student debt, and the need for free education. Strikers and their supporters, would affix a small red square (attached to this card with a safety pin) to show their solidarity for the movement.

Around 12:45 AM, they began making dispersal orders via a loudspeaker. By 1 AM, the park was completely fenced off and no one was allowed beyond the police barricades. Emergency texts, tweets, and livestreamed recordings made their way throughout the city's activist networks: Occupy Wall Street was being evicted. Protesters quickly made their way downtown to defend the park, and those who resisted the cops were pepper sprayed, beaten, and arrested. In two short hours, much of the Occupy Wall Street encampment was destroyed. By 5 AM, city sanitation dump trucks carried away the bulk of the encampment's infrastructure. Protestors would later sue the city over its destruction of more than 5,500 books from the People's Library, computers—which the city had ensured were recoverable, bicycles that were used to generate electricity, and more. In the following months, Occupy existed and persisted in a kind of exile, searching for a new home. More than 50 protesters, including clergy members, were arrested the following month during the D17 action to take over Duarte Square and the march that ensued when NYPD squashed this action. This flyer discusses the Occupy movement after the eviction, noting that ""We occupied Zuccotti Park as a provocation, but that became beside the point. Living together and building a community quickly captured our attention."" In this way, the flyer, in the form of a ""direct communication"" poses that the real and persisting threat of Occupy to the status quo, to the police, and to the ruling elite, is the establishment of a ""self-contained functional community"" that does not rely on capitalist and carceral systems.

On March 22, 2012, demonstrators from Occupy Wall Street were joined by Trayvon Martin's family, including his mother Sabrina Fulton and father Tracy Martin, for the ""Million Hoodie March"" during which the protesters marched from Union Square to Times Square. During the march, Sabrina Fulton gave a speech saying ""My son is your son."" As an early example of social media activism, also called hashtag activism, a tactic used throughout the Occupy movement, the flyer for the protest invites demonstrators to post on social media with #MillionHoodies. The flyer also calls for protestors to ""Say No to Racial Profiling"" and ""Say No to Stop and Frisk,"" two major issues that the Occupy movement took up in response to NYPD's violent policing tactics of surveilling and harassing Black and Brown communities. In this way, Occupy called attention to the overlapping and interconnected issues of white supremacy, racialized violence, and policing in the United States.

",23,"*Content Warning: This caption includes description of transphobia and cissexism* This statement, titled ""OWS Must Resist Cis-Supremacy and Trans Misogyny,"" and signed by ""a bunch of trans women occupiers,"" calls for accountability within Occupy Wall Street. The statement, which was first circulated online, and was later printed as a flyer to be distributed in-person, followed the November 9th General Assembly. During this meeting, members from the Queering OWS Caucus were disrupted by trans-exclusionary feminist groups, Women Occupying Nations and Strong Women, while the Queering OWS Caucus spoke out about issues of sexual assault and racism within the movement. The statement reminds readers that the ""elimination of systemic oppression against marginalized people is a core goal of the Occupy movement"" and calls for trans-exclusionary groups to be blocked from participation in the New York General Assembly. Citing their significant contributions to the movement, including the ""creation and operation of OccupyWallSt.org,"" the signers note that they ""are prepared to leave the New York General Assembly and its empowered Spokes Council en masse if trans-excluding groups, spaces, and individuals continue to be tolerated by this body.” The signers also demand the adoption of a trans-inclusive safer spaces policy. After the release of this statement, in December 2011, activist, artist, and filmmaker Tourmaline wrote ""An Open Letter for Gender Self-Determination in/at OWS"" in the first issue of Post Post Script, a publication which circulated during Occupy. Tourmaline states, ""As long as there has been trans leadership, particularly trans women leadership, in movements for self-determination, we have faced resistance and ejection from the very movements we have helped to make."" Tourmaline reminds the reader that Occupy Wall Street is repeating the harms of the 1973 Washington Square Rally, during which organizers allowed Lesbian Feminist Liberation to remove Sylvia Rivera, a trans woman activist, from speaking. Tourmaline closes her note by saying ""I want to remind each other with love that an investment in biologically determined gender is an investment in identities that were violently imposed on our bodies in order to maintain capitalism, white supremacy, and colonialism. That is why it is not good enough to just have non-trans queer women, gender queer people, and trans men in these spaces and claim them as trans affirming. That is why it is not OK to non-consensually gender other people. That is why we must support the leadership of those who have faced historical exile and isolation from feminist and queer space.

As a decision-making body, NYCGA based its principles and strategies in anarchist praxis and functioned horizontally, using a modified-consensus-based system. In a spokes-council model, the General Assembly was comprised of multiple working groups who organized autonomously around issues like access to/distribution of food, media and communications, direct action, legal support, and more. The Archives Working Group, who donated a large collection of records created during the course of the Occupy movement, the records of which comprise this exhibit, were one such group at Occupy. The NYCGA took inspiration from similar assemblies that operated in Egypt's Tahrir Square and Madrid's Puerta del Sol. The use of the ""people's mic,"" an organic way to amplify speech through repetition, was popularized at the General Assembly. This three page, tri-fold pamphlet is a kind of primer to the NYCGA, introducing the reader to how the NYCGA operates and inviting the reader to join. In the weeks following Occupy's eviction from Zuccotti, joining the GA became more challenging as police refused individuals carrying large bags entry into the park. Facilitators for the GA began to allow emergency proposals to be made without having them first circulate in advance, and activists took to live-tweeting the GA in order to communicate broadly.",,4,A tri-fold pamphlet introducing the New York City General Assembly,"On the cover of this tri-fold pamphlet is a foregrounded image of the Wall Street bull with a dancer pirouetting on its back.

After the 2008 market crash, home values plummeted across the country, and homeowners who were the victims of predatory lending found themselves in the position of having outstanding loans with a higher principle than the market value of their house.

Introduced by Republican Governor Scott Walker, Act 10 placed severe limitations on collective bargaining rights for the state's public sector employees and made drastic cuts to their benefits. The law also made it illegal for employers to collect union dues from paychecks, even with a worker’s consent. Wisconsin’s public sector unions have lost about 70 percent of their members since 2011. Activists were able to initiate a recall election in 2012, but Walker defeated the Democratic nominee Tom Barrett. The Obama administration did little to support Wisconsin activists or Barrett's campaign in 2011-2012. Walker later signed a right-to-work law in 2015, further weakening the influence of unions in the state. The protests at the Capitol involved tens of thousands of people, and they garnered much attention in labor and left media throughout 2011. Public sector workers and other activists sought to link their struggle to a long history of bipartisan attacks on unions, particularly since the 1980s.
