The goverment responded by enacting Bill 12, also called Billed 78, which pressured students to end their demonstrations by enacting provisions that forced students to return to their coursework and limited their rights to protest. Students in the United States took inspiration from the actions of the Québec student strike, and brought similar critiques about the corporatization of higher education, untenable tuitiion and fees, rising student debt, and the need for free education.

Wagner Labor Archives, New York University",Unknown,,"23,20","*Content Warning: This caption includes description of police brutality* Shortly after midnight on November 15th, police in riot gear took up strategic positions around Zucotti Park, and around 12:45, they began making dispersal orders via loudspeaker. By 1 AM, the park was completely fenced off and no one was allowed beyond the police barricades. Emergency texts, tweets, and livestreamed recordings made their way througout the city's activitst networks: Occupy Wall Street was being evicted. Protesters quickly made their way downtown to defend  the park and those who resisted the cops were pepper sprayed, beaten, and arrested. In two short hours, much of the two month-long Occupy Wall Street encampment was destroyed. By 5 am, city sanitation dump trucks carried away the bulk of the encampment's infrastructure. Occupiers would later sue the city over its destruction of more than 3,000 books from the People's Library, computers -- which the city had ensured were recoverable, bicycles that were used to generate electricity, and more. In the following months, Occupy existed and persisted in a kind of exile, searching for a new home. More than 50 protesters, including clergy members, were arrested the following month during the D17 action to occupy Duarte Square and the ensuing march. This flyer discusses the Occupy movement after the eviction, noting that ""We occupied Zuccott Park as a provoation, but that became beside the point. Living together and building a community quickly captured our attention."" In this way, the flyer, in the form of a ""direct communication"" poses that the real and persisting  threat of Occupy to the status quo, to the police, and to the ruling elite, is the establishment of a ""self-contained functional community"" that does not rely on capitalist and carceral systems.

This statement, which was first circulated online and was later printed as a flyer to be distributed in-person, appears to have been released following the November 9th General Assembly, during which members from the Queering OWS Caucus were disrupted by Women Occupying Nations while speaking out about issues of sexual assault and racism within the movement. The statement reminds readers that the ""elimination of systemic oppression against marginalized people is a core goal of the Occupy movement"" and calls for trans-exclusionary groups to be blocked from participation in the New York General Assembly. Citing their significant contributions to the movement, including the ""creation and operation of OccupyWallSt.org,"" the signers note that they ""are prepared to leave the New York General Assembly and its empowered Spokes Council en masse if trans-excluding groups, spaces, and individuals continue to be tolerated by this body"" and demand the adoption of a trans-inclusive safer spaces policy. Following the release of this statement, in December 2011, activist, artists, and filmmaker wrote ""An Open Letter for Gender Self-Determination in/at OWS"" in the first issue of Post Post Script, a publication which circulated during Occupy Wall Street. Tourmaline states, ""As long as there has been trans leadership, particularly trans women leadership, in movements for self determination, we have faced resistance and ejection from the very movements we have helped to make."" Tourmaline reminds the reader that Occupy Wall Street is repeating the harms of the 1973 Washington Square Rally, during which organizers allowed Lesbian Feminist Liberation to remove Sylvia Rivera, a transwoman activist, from speaking. Tourmaline loses her note by saying ""I want to remind each other with love that an investment in biologically determined gender is an investment in identities that were violently imposed on our bodies in order to maintain capitalism, white supremacy, and colonialism. That is why it is no good enough to just have non-trans queer women/gender queer people and trans men in these spaces and claim them as trans affirming. That is why it is not OK to non-consensually gender other people. That is why we must support the leadership of those who have faced historical exile and isolation from feminist and queer space.

Introduced by Republican Governor Scott Walker, Act 10 placed severe limitations on collective bargaining rights for the state's public sector employees and made drastic cuts to their benefits. The law also made it illegal for employers to collect union dues from paychecks, even with a workers consent. Wisconsin’s public sector unions have lost about 70 percent of their members since 2011. Activists were able to initiate a recall election in 2012, but Walker defeated the Democratic nomiee Tom Barrett. The Obama administration did little to support Wisconsin activists or Barrett's campaign in 2011/2012. Walker later signed a right-to-work law in 2015, further weakening the influence of unions in the state. 

The protests at the Capitol involved tens of thousands of people and garnered much attention in labor and left media throughout 2011. Public sector workers and other acitivists sought to link their struggle to a long history of bipartisan attacks on unions, particularly since the 1980s.

They hosted teach-ins that focused on the connections between Occupy, the recent death of Trayvon Martin, and the over policing of their communities and the privitization of their public school system. Their school was one of more than 100 that were closed down due to the education policies of the Bloomberg administration. The NYC Department of Education voted to close Robeson in 2011, but allowed students to remain until 2014. The students also called for free GED classes and greater diversity in terms of their history education. ""We're not out here to play around. Let's make a change--knowledge is power, we're out here to learn,"" said one student who organized the rally.
