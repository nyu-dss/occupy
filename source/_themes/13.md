label: Wealth Disparityâ€”Student Debt
description: Student activists were at the forefront of the Occupy movement. As part
  of Occupy's broader effort to highlight economic inequality, activists were encouraged
  to share their personal stories of debt during the fall of 2011. Occupy demonstrators,
  and supporters across the country, launched an online campaign. Using social media,
  individuals held handwritten signs divulging the total amount they owed for their
  student loans. The protests sparked a new movement that has continued to call for
  universal student debt cancellation, and initiatives like the Rolling Jubilee Fund.
