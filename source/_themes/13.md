pid: '13'
label: Wealth Disparity â€“ Student Debt
description: As part of Occupy's broader effort to highlight economic inequality,
  activists were encouraged to share their personal stories of debt during the fall
  of 2011. Occupier and supporters across the country soon divulged details online
  using handwritten signs with the total amount of they owed for their student loans.
  The protests sparked a new movement that has continued to call for universal student
  debt cancellation, and initiatives like the Rolling Jubilee Fund which raised money
  to buy student loan debt for pennies on the dollar from collectors, and then forgiving
  the loans altogether
