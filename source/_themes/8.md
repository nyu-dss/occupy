label: Organized Labor – Power of Unions
description: After a decades long decline in union membership, Occupy Wall Street
  was one of several events in the 21st century that helped spurred a renewed interest
  in unions, particularly among young people on the left. By October 2011, Occupy
  had garnered enough attention to receive significant support from labor unions,
  including those that typically avoided confrontational tactics. “Our members have
  been trying to have this discussion about Wall Street and the economy for a long
  time,” AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in an interview. “This movement is
  providing us the vehicle.” Aside from the presence of union members at Zucotti,
  influential labor unions provided office space, meeting rooms, photocopying services,
  legal help, and food to demonstrators. The partnership also led to Occupiers participating
  in union actions that fall, including a protest organized by telephone workers that
  was aimed at Verizon's abusive practives. The tenuous alliance was reflective of
  their shared frustrations with the Obama administration's lack of support for organized
  labor.
