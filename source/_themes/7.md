description: 'Occupy Wall Street brought increased attention to labor issues in 2011-2012
  through its focus on economic inequality. By shining a light on the plight of low-wage
  workers and pushing for a higher minimum wage, Occupy drew attention to the concerns
  of the non-unionized working class in the United States. NYC fastfood workers staged
  a publicized walk-out in the fall of 2012 that was replicated in other communities
  over the next few years. The initial action was organized by New York Communities
  for Change, an early supporter of the Occupy protests. The subsequent rise of the
  Fight for 15 movement, and increased coverage of service-sector workers, further
  expanded Occupy''s push for a more robust labor movement. '
