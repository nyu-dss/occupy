label: Policing/Police Brutality, Prison Industrial Complex
description: 'Occupy originally focused on economic inequality, but issues surrounding
  police brutality and the prison industrial complex were quickly incorporated into
  the movement''s priorities. Police brutality became an even more pressing issue
  for Occupiers following a series of brutal attacks from the NYPD that fall. Demonstrators
  developed connections with other community groups who opposed the NYPD''s racial
  profiling and military tactics, and soon expanded their critique of policing to
  the American prison system. Police and prison reform would eventually become foundational
  issues for social justic activists during the 2010s. '
