pid: '9'
label: Policing, Police Brutality,  and the Prison Industrial Complex
description: Occupy originally focused on economic inequality, but issues surrounding
  police brutality and the prison industrial complex were quickly incorporated into
  the movement's priorities. Police brutality became an even more pressing issue for
  activists following a series of brutal attacks from the NYPD in the fall of 2011.
  Demonstrators developed connections with other community groups who opposed the
  NYPD's racial profiling and military-style tactics, and they soon expanded their
  critique of policing to the American prison system.
