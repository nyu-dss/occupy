description: At the same time that Occupy Wall Street protestors faced surveillance
  by the FBI, NYPD, and the Department of Homeland Security, protestors also called
  attention to the efforts of whistleblowers like Chelsea Manning, who leaked classified
  military and diplomatic records. In this way, while Occupy Wall Street experienced
  suppression by government agents, those same activists fought back and found inspiration
  in acts of resistance against government, military, and police secrecy.
