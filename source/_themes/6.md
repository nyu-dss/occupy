label: Inequality and Discrimination
description: 'While Occupy decried police brutality, fought against the ballooning
  housing crisis, and named and confronted economic inequalities—in particular, policies
  that negatively impacted the poor—the movement faced its own internal struggles
  against systemic oppression. Though many of the activists embraced anti-oppressive
  values, and were actively engaged in dismantling power imbalances, the movement
  itself perpetuated status-quo structures of oppression. In spite of Occupy''s commitment
  to non-hierarchical organizing, preexisting societal notions of white, cis, abled,
  male normativity created fractures in the movement, and the persistence of these
  harms most impacted people of color, women, trans, non-binary, and disabled activists. '
