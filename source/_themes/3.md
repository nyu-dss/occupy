description: The Occupy Wall Street movement intersected with environmental activism
  on a number of issues related to climate change and environmental degradation. In
  particular, the movements coalesced around the Keystone XL Pipeline as protestors
  found common ground in the understanding that governments, corporate greed, and
  the ultra-wealthy place profits above people and the environment.
