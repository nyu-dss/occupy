description: While the United States' military presence in Iraq and Afghanistan was
  not a central focus at Occupy Wall Street, Occupy unquestionably evolved on the
  heels of the Bush-era anti-war movement. As one example of the intersections of
  the two movements, on the 10th anniversary of the war in Afghanistan, Occupy and
  anti-war protestors converged on Washington D.C. As the Obama Administration continued
  many of Bush's policies in Afghanistan and Iraq, themes of anti-imperialism and
  anti-war were not uncommon at Occupy Wall Street
