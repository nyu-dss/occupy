label: Anti-Imperialism and Anti-War
description: Occupy evolved on the heels of the Bush-era anti-war movement. As one
  example of the intersection of the two movements, on the 10th anniversary of the
  war in Afghanistan, Occupy and anti-war protestors converged on Washington D.C.
  As the Obama administration continued many of Bush's policies in Afghanistan and
  Iraq, themes of anti-imperialism and anti-war were not uncommon at Occupy Wall Street.
