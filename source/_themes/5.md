description: 'Independent media was core to on-the-ground communications at Occupy,
  and protestors circulated information through a variety of means including newsletters,
  pamphlets, and a newspaperâ€”the Occupied Wall Street Journal. Mainstream media coverage
  of the movement was often inaccurate or disparaging, and protestors seized the opportunity
  to create their own content and communicate their own narratives. '
