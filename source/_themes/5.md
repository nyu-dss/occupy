description: From pamphlets to newsletters to the Occupied Wall Street Journal, independent
  media was core to on-the-ground communications at Occupy. Mainstream media coverage
  of the movement was often inaccurate or disparaging, and protestors seized the opportunity
  to create their own media. Independent news outlets like Democracy Now! and Pacifica
  Radio provided significant coverage of the movement and often gave protestors a
  platform to tell their own stories.
