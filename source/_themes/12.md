label: Wealth Disparity â€“ Housing
description: Housing rights was one of the primary concerns of Occupy Wall Street
  in response to the the foreclosure crisis. The crisis, in which banks increasingly
  seized properties following years of predatory lending in 2007, was compounded by
  the Great Recession of 2008. As a result, 10 million people lost their homes between
  2007-2010. After a period of widespread predatory lending and unregulated markets,
  the federal government did little to combat the growing housing crisis in the United
  States during the 2010s.
