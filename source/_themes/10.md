description: "Gathering in the middle of New York City's financial district, Occupy
  Wall Street demonstrators pushed the American public to learn more about the scale
  of political and financial corruption that led to the 2008/2009 recession. \"Banks
  got bailed out, we got sold out!\" was a common refrain at Occupy, as protesters
  echoed the lingering frustrations of Americans who felt that the CEOs, who were
  responsible for the fraud that led to the financial collapse, were not held accountable
  for their actions. \n"
