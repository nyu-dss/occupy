description: "Gathering in the middle of New York City's financial district, Occupiers
  pushed the American public to learn more about the scale of political and financial
  corruptiion that led to the 2008/2009 recession. \"\"Banks got bailed out, we got
  sold out!\" was a common refrain at Occupy, as protesters echoed the lingering frustrations
  of Americans who felt that the CEOs who were responsible for the fraud that led
  to the financial collapse were not held acccountable for their actions. \n"
