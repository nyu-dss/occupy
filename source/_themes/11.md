description: '"We are the 99 percent" became the iconic slogan of the fall of 2011,
  as Occupy Wall Street played an important role in elevating the issue of wealth
  disparity into mainstream discourse. Between 1979 and 2007, the top 1 percent of
  households secured 59.9 percent of all gains in income, while the bottom 90 percent
  only received 8.6 percent. After decades of redistributive policies that directly
  benefitted the rich, working class Americans were increasingly questioning their
  future place within the American capitalist system. '
