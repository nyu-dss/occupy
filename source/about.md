### **Land Acknowledgement**

The Tamiment Library and Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives is located in Lenapehoking, so-called “New York City,” the unceded land of the Lenape people. Hundreds of thousands of Indigenous peoples live in New York City, and their care for the land and waters, their cultures, and their communities persist in the face of ongoing settler colonialism.

Indigenous peoples across Turtle Island have always been at the forefront of movement work that confronts the violence of racial capitalism. At the outset of Occupy Wall Street, Indigenous people called into question what it meant to “Occupy” already occupied, stolen, Indigenous lands. Who exactly were the 99% if the Occupy movement failed to include Indigenous people and forefront Indigenous sovereignty? How could a movement seek to claim spaces created by corrupt governments and corporate wealth without first confronting the historical legacies of colonialism and the ways settler colonialism was ingrained in the tactics, frameworks, and language of the movement itself?

We uplift Indigenous-led defense of the lands and waters against deforestation, fracking, pipelines, overfishing, and settler destruction of fragile ecosystems. At present, there are more than eighteen land and water defense actions and blockades taking place across Turtle Island. Indigenous Two Spirit, Queer, Femme, and youth activists are at these frontlines. We invite visitors to this digital exhibit to support frontline land defenders and water protectors. This is not a fully comprehensive list; however, a few places to learn more and to donate include:

### **Gratitude**

This digital exhibit would not be possible without the Occupy Wall Street Archives Working Group’s generous donation of the [Occupy Wall Street Archives Working Group Collection](http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/tamwag/tam_630/). We are grateful to them for their trust in our ability to responsibly care for, and provide access to, their records. This exhibition also uses selections of materials from the [John Penley Photographs and Papers](http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/tamwag/tam_501/) collection, and materials that were collected and assembled as a part of our [Printed Ephemera on Subjects](http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/tamwag/pe_029/) collection.

In response to the pandemic, we made the difficult decision to refocus the scope and overall framing of this exhibit and transform it from an installation in our exhibition space to a digital exhibit. This transition would not have been possible without the support of many of our colleagues.

Marii Nyrop, who works with NYU Libraries Digital Scholarship Services designed [Wax](https://marii.info/projects/wax), the open source software on which this exhibition is built. Without Marii’s guidance, support, and technical expertise, this exhibition would not be possible. Michael Stasiak and Carol Kassel, who work with NYU Libraries Digital Library and Technology Services, supported the digital photography of the oversized collection material. Web Archivist Nicole Greenhouse both documented Occupy's web presence at the time of the movement, and encouraged us to incorporate links to web archives to associated print materials like flyers and pamphlets. This significantly broadened the kinds of materials you are able to experience here.

Our colleagues in the Barbara Goldsmith Conservation and Preservation Department, including Dawn Mankowski, Lou Di Gennaro, and Laura McCann have ensured that the Occupy collection material has been carefully preserved, and they assessed collection materials to ensure their durability for digitization. We are grateful to all of our colleagues in Special Collections for their ongoing support and feedback, and especially to Felix Esquivel who managed the intra-departmental movement of collections. Within Archives Collections Management Amy Vo, Anna McCormick, and Weatherly Stephan coordinated the incorporation of newly scanned materials into the [OWS Archives Working Group Finding Aid](http://dlib.nyu.edu/findingaids/html/tamwag/tam_630/).


### **Accessibility**

[NYU has adopted the World Wide Web Consortium’s Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.nyu.edu/about/policies-guidelines-compliance/policies-and-guidelines/website-accessibility.html) (WCAG) 2.0, Level AA as its standard for digital accessibility.

In addition to following these guidelines, we utilized a suite of accessibility evaluation tools to ensure our exhibit is more accessible to individuals with disabilities. We have also included alt-text and image descriptions to provide vital image information to Blind and low vision people.


### **Safety**

[Occupy Wall Street was highly surveilled by the NYPD and the United States Government](https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/fbi-surveillance-occupy-wall-street-detailed-huffingtonpostcom). For many people involved in Occupy, who remain involved in various movement work, we expect that these individuals continue to be surveilled. While our agreements allow for us to freely exhibit collections materials, we want to present a digital exhibition that does not aid the carceral state in its efforts to harass and intimidate activists. Where names and personal contact information are present in the documents, we made the decision to redact that data. Similarly, where protesters' faces were visible in photographs, we cropped those photos such that the information we intended to convey is still visible, but the activists' faces are not.

This exhibit examines topics like white supremacy, police brutality, racism, sexual assault, cissexism and transphobia, and abelism that are harmful and triggering. We take your safety as a participant in this exhibit seriously and we have added content warnings so that you may opt out of interacting with various aspects of this exhibit.


### **Structure of Exhibit**

This exhibition is structurally organized around Occupy Wall Street’s _[Declaration of the Occupation of New York City](https://nyu-dss.github.io/occupy/declarations/)_ and [thirteen themes](https://nyu-dss.github.io/occupy/themes/), both of which speak to significant concerns within the movement. While the _Declaration _was drafted by the Call to Action Working Group and ratified by New York City General Assembly (NYCGA) on September 29, 2011, the themes have been identified and presented by the curators of this exhibit.
