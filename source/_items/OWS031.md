description: '*Content warning: This caption includes description of settler colonialism,
  political prisoners, and state sanctioned violence of Indigenous people* When John
  Paul Montano authored his open letter critiquing Occupy Wall Street''s failure to
  center Indigenous people—and its use of colonial language, framing, and tactics—one
  of his recommendations to Occupy Wall Street was that Occupy "Demand immediate freedom
  for Indigenous political prisoner Leonard Peltier." This flyer, created by the NYC
  Leonard Peltier Defense Offense Committee, in support of Leonard Peltier''s clemency
  application, circulated through the Occupy Wall Street movement. Peltier is a member
  of the American Indian Movement who has been a political prisoner since 1977. He
  was wrongfully convicted of first-degree murder following a shootout at the Pine
  Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota that led to the deaths of two FBI agents.
  Peltier admitted to being present at the shootout, but still denies that he shot
  the FBI agents. Human rights organizations, including Amnesty International, have
  argued for clemency due to inconsistencies in the prosecution''s case, but he remains
  in prison.'
