description: A flyer created by the NYC Leonard Peltier Defence Offence Committee
  in support of Leonard Peltier's clemency application. Peltier was a member of the
  American Indian Movement who has been imprisoned since 1977. He was convicted of
  first-degree murder following a shoot out at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in
  South Dakota that led to the deaths of two FBI agents. Peltier admitted to being
  present at the shoot-out, but still denies that he shot the FBI agents. Human rights
  organizations, including Amnesty International have argued for clemency due to inconsistencies
  in the prosecution's case, but he remains in prison.
