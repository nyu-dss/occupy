description: 'This photograph is of a banner that reads "Occupy the Lens: The World
  is Watching" which perhaps carries several meanings. It can be read as a call to
  document the movement and take charge of media; it can also be read as a call to
  take control of and dismantle surveillance technologies and to resist the monitoring
  of protestors. This photograph has been cropped by the curators to protect the identity
  of the individual carrying the banner.'
