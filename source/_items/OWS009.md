description: Located in East Harlem, El Barrio, NYC, Movement for Justice in El Barrio
  is "a majority-women community organization that fights for housing justice, immigrant
  justice and gender justice and, following our unique model, consistently challenges
  multiple forms of oppression, including xenophobia, racism, sexism, transphobia,
  and homophobia." In the third month of Occupy Wall Street, Movement for Justice
  in El Barrio invited activists from Occupy Wall Street to "our corner of the world
  for an evening of dialogue. We will share our stories of resistance and memories
  of victory, as we bring to life our dreams of a world of justice, dignity, and democracy."
  The dialogue between Movement for Justice in El Barrio (MJEB) and Occupy Wall Street
  (OWS) is demonstrative of the coalitional approach of organizations like MJEB, an
  approach that OWS attempted to replicate as a horizontal, leaderful, and "big umbrella"
  movement.

  Occupy Wall Street" on the topic "Dignity is an Echo in the Heartbeat of the People."
  The flyer includes a date and time (November 7th, 7pm), location (Julia De Burgos
