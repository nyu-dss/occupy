description: Located in East Harlem, Movement for Justice in El Barrio is "a majority-women
  community organization that fights for housing justice, immigrant justice and gender
  justice and, following our unique model, consistently challenges multiple forms
  of oppression, including xenophobia, racism, sexism, transphobia, and homophobia."
  In the third month of Occupy Wall Street, Movement for Justice in El Barrio invited
  activists from Occupy Wall Street to "our corner of the world for an evening of
  dialogue. We will share our stories of resistance and memories of victory, as we
  bring to life our dreams of a world of justice, dignity, and democracy." The dialogue
  between Movement for Justice in El Barrio (MJEB) and Occupy Wall Street (OWS) is
  demonstrative of the coalitional approach of organizations like MJEB, an approach
  that OWS attempted to replicate as a horizontal, leaderful, and "big umbrella" movement.
