description: 'The People of Color (POC) Working Group was officially formed on October
  1st, 2011, following a General Assembly decision about the wording of the Declaration
  of the Occupation of New York. In that General Assembly, a core group of POC activists
  blocked the proposal to solidify the Declaration, calling attention to the fact
  that the original wording of the Declaration failed to acknowledge the historical,
  ongoing, and very present—even within the Occupy movement—forces of racism and systemic
  oppression. The authors of the Declaration, the Call to Action group, resisted making
  a change to the wording of the document; however, the POC activists'' block held
  and the language was changed. The POC Working Group carved out important and safer
  spaces for activists of color within Occupy, challenged white privilege within the
  movement, and—among other significant actions—forged necessary connections with
  community organizations who were reticent to work alongside white protestors. '

  "People of Color Working Group!" is handwritten. In between "People of Color" and
