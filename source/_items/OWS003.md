description: "*Content Warning: This caption includes description of police brutality
  and sexual assault.* On the six-month anniversary of Occupy, hundreds of protestors
  gathered in Zuccotti Park. Police abruptly declared the park closed at 11:30 PM,
  immediately moved into the park, and began brutalizing protestors with batons. Though
  this flyer does not speak directly of her experience, it was during this six-month
  anniversary gathering that Cecily McMillan was sexually assaulted, beaten, and arrested
  by NYPD. McMillian was ultimately charged with felony second-degree assault of a
  police officer. In a trial that was criticized as a miscarriage of justice, and
  became a rallying cry against the inequities of the justice system, McMillian was
  convicted of her charges, and was sentenced to three months in prison and five years
  of probation. She served fifty-eight days at Rikers Island. This flyer calls for
  an emergency response to the brutality that protestors, inclusive of McMillian,
  faced on March 17, 2012. It is not only a document of the harassment and violence
  that Occupy protestors faced at the hands of NYPD, but it demonstrates how fluidly,
  in a leaderful movement, protestors were able to organize themselves into action."
