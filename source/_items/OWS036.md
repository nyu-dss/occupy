description: The one-year anniversary of Occupy called for a whole day of actions
  beginning at 7 AM and ending at 8 PM. With protests taking place across all of lower
  Manhattan, over the course of 13 hours, the tactical framework for this "roving
  carnival of resistance," was designed to be all-encompassing and overwhelming to
  the cops. Organizers for S17, September 17th, prepared various forms of support
  from medical, to legal, to food, to creating a safe spaceâ€”all necessary components
  for a day-long action.

image_description: A double-sided, black and white, typescript document outlines the
  tactical strategies for the S17 (September 17th) actions. It provides a sequence
  of events, a list of the different thematic zones for the action (for example, 99
  %, Education, Debt, and Eco), a list of various support roles and places where folks
  can gather for a "safe space," and it offers the various means of communication
  that activists will use throughout the day.
