description: The Occupier was one of many periodicals launched during Occupy Wall
  Street, and it is an example of the various forms of grassroots media that circulated
  by and about OWS during the height of the movement. The Occupier was produced by
  Organizing for Occupation, O4O, who primarily focused on issues of housing rights,
  foreclosure, and evictionsâ€”some of the chief concerns of Occupy Wall Street. These
  issues were exacerbated by widespread foreclosures in the United States, primarily
  between 2007-2010, also known as the foreclosure crisis. The foreclosure crisis
  was compounded by the Great Recession of 2008. Both of these events gave rise to
  the Occupy movement.

image_description: 'A two-page newsletter called "The Occupier," authored by Organizing
  for Occupation, offers four articles: one describing the nature of Organizing for
  Occupation and what they hope to achieve; one amplifying the success of blocking
  the eviction of Mary Lee Ward; a third that describes the process of foreclosure
  and demanding a foreclosure moratorium; and a fourth that describes a wheel of participation
  inviting many different opportunities to join the group. Contact information and
  a meeting place are provided on the second page.'
