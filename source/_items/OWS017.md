description: 'Throughout the movement, Occupy Wall Street issued calls and appeals
  for support, sometimes in the form of material support like supplies. This email
  was sent through the Fast Mail message service on October 14, 2011 from donors who
  sent a camping pad and sleeping bag to assist those at Zuccotti. The donors had
  responded to one of Occupy’s calls. Aside from sleeping bags, blankets, and tarps,
  the organizers also requested materials for their street medic team including duct
  tape, cold medicine, and baby wipes. Personal email address and names have been
  redacted by the curators of this exhibit. '
