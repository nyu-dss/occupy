description: 'Throughout the movement, Occupy Wall Street issued calls and appeals
  for support, sometimes in the form of material support like supplies. This email
  was sent through Fast Mail message service on 10/14/11 from donors who sent a camping
  pad and sleeping bag to assist those at Zucotti. The donors had responded to an
  Occupy call for support. Aside from sleeping bags, blankets, and tarps, the organizers
  also requested materials for their street medic team including duct tape, cold medicine,
  and baby wipes. Personal email address and names have been blocked out by the curators
  of this exhibit. '
