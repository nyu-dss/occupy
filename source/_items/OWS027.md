description: 'In lieu of Occupy''s struggles to meet the "day-to-day operational needs
  of working groups and caucuses," the OWS Structure Group produced this proposal
  for future organizing during the fall of 2011. This "living document" sought to
  address logistical challenges without altering OWSâ€™ non-hierarchical nature. Organizers
  identified challenges such as access, transparency, functionality, and decision
  making as part of a broader effort to maintain a leaderful structure during Occupy. '
