description: By one account, this sign links economic injustice within the United
  States to the United States’ imperialism abroad. Although the Obama administration
  was in the process of withdrawing troops from Iraq, it also decided to increase
  the nation's troop levels in Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010. Anti-war activism had
  waned by 2011, but critiques of American imperialism persisted during the Obama
  years. The sign reads, "Arrest Financial Terrorists, End the Evil Empire, Troops
  Home from Europe/Asia." The opposite side of the sign reveals a more conspiratorial
  slant, warning of “the order”—a nod to a conspiracy theory that hypothesizes the
  emergence of a global totalitarian government—and encourages the reader to refuse
  vaccination, hoard gold and silver, and purchase a fire arm. In 2021, we see these
  same messages being vocalized on the far-right. Though Occupy was by and large a
  protest initiated, organized, and carried out by the left, right-wing participation,
  particularly among Libertarians, was not a complete anomaly—then GOP presidential
  primary candidate Gary Johnson expressed his solidarity with the movement and met
  with protesters.

image_description: Several sheets of white paper are held together by masking tape
  in order to create the front side of this sign. Across the sign in black marker
  the text says "Arrest Financial Terrorists" A line is drawn below this text and
  below the sign says, "End the Evil Empire (Troops Home from Europe/Asia)." The opposite
  side of the sign is written in cursive handwriting and says, "This is exactly what
  they want and you are handing them the one reason they need to implement the order.
  For now or ever that matter do not vaccinate! Do not sell your gold/silver & get
  a gun!" In the upper right hand corner is a small pyramid with an eye at its center,
  reminiscent of an Illuminati symbol.
