description: 'Sign that reads, "Arrest Financial Terrorists, End the Evil Empire,
  Troops Home from Europe/Asia." One of several signs in the collection that linked
  economic injustice within the United States to imperialism abroad.  Although the
  Obama adminsitration was in the process of withdrawing troops from Iraq, they also
  decided to increase the nation''s troop levels in Afghanistan in 2009 and 2010.
  Antiwar activism had waned by 2011, but critiques of American imperialism persisted
  on the left during the Obama years. '
