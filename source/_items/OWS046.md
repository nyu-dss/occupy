description: 'It is unclear if this cardboard sign that reads, "Organizing through
  a Racial Justice Framework-OWS People''s Free Library" refers to a topical section
  with the Library that contained resources related to Racial Justice organizing work,
  or if this sign is meant to indicate that the People''s Free Library was a space
  informed by Racial Justice frameworks. The People''s Library held a collection of
  more than 5,000 items in November 2011, including a wide range of books and periodicals
  from multiple points of view. The American Library Association (ALA) stated that
  the Library "reflected many of ALA’s core intellectual freedom values and best practices—a
  balanced, cataloged collection, representing diverse points of view, that included
  children’s books and reference service often provided by professional librarians."
  The NYPD seized the Library in the early morning hours of November 15th during its
  raid of Zuccotti Park, destroying more than 5,500 books, laptops, and other critical
  infrastructure for the Library. '
