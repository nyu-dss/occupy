  Whether it was the call for a jubilee on student, or feeling drawn to other causes under the Occupy Wall Street umbrella, students from across New York City's colleges and universities were a large presence in on-the-ground protests, working groups, and actions. Students at New York University formed an Occupy affinity group called NYU for Occupy Wall Street. They coordinated student-led actions from, and in opposition to, the University. This included the occupation of university-owned buildings like the Stern School of Business on Gould Plaza and walk-outs like the one called for in this flyer. This walkout was a part of a coordinated nation-wide effort that included student protests at more than 75 campuses across the country, much of which was organized through social media.

image_description: This double-sided flyer is a yellow page with black text, and it
  tells the reader to "Join NYU students, faculty and staff as we march to meet the
  Community/Labor March to Wall Street!" The flyer provides details including the
  date and time (Wednesday, October 5th at 4pm) and contact information including
  an email address and a hashtag. The front of the flyer includes a raised fist carrying
  a torch, an emblem of NYU. The flyer notes that the march is endorsed by "unions
  and community groups including United Federation of Teachers, SEIU 32BJ and SEIU
  1100, the Transit Workers Union Local 100, Make the Road New York, New Yorkers Against
  Budget Cuts, and Alliance for Quality Education."
