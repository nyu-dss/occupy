description: 'Housing was a significant logistical issue for Occupy. Meeting minutes
  from various General Assemblies demonstrate that the Housing Spokes Council contended
  with significant issues like activist accountability and how to deal with budget
  issues to support the costs of sheltering activists at multiple local organizations.
  This cardboard sign reads "Gay Squat 2011-2012: Come In and Come Out." Gay Squat
  may refer to a loose group of LGBTQIA activists who lived together in housing that
  was not officially under the purview of Occupy. It also tacitlysuggests that—even
  though LGBTQIA+ activist organizations like ACT UP NY, Queerocracy, and Queer Rising
  often worked in coalition with, or were directly embedded in, Occupy—LGBTQIA activists
  in the movement still sometimes faced challenges of visibility and safety within
  the movement, having to "come in" in order to "come out."'
