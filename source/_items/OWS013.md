description: '*Content Warning: This caption includes description of the state sanctioned
  murder of Black individuals in the United States* On February 26, 2012, 17-year-old
  Trayvon Benjamin Martin was murdered by George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. Trayvon
  was murdered while wearing a hoodie and carrying a bag of Skittles candy—both of
  which became symbols in the protests leading up to Zimmerman''s April 11th indictment
  on murder charges. On March 22, 2012, demonstrators from Occupy Wall Street were
  joined by Trayvon Martin''s family, including his mother Sabrina Fulton and father
  Tracy Martin, for the "Million Hoodie March" during which the protesters marched
  from Union Square to Times Square. During the march, Sabrina Fulton gave a speech
  saying "My son is your son." As an early example of social media activism, also
  called hashtag activism, a tactic used throughout the Occupy movement, the flyer
  for the protest invites demonstrators to post on social media with #MillionHoodies.
  The flyer also calls for protestors to "Say No to Racial Profiling" and "Say No
  to Stop and Frisk," two major issues that the Occupy movement took up in response
  to NYPD''s violent policing tactics of surveilling and harassing Black and Brown
  communities. In this way, Occupy called attention to the overlapping and interconnected
  issues of white supremacy, racialized violence, and policing in the United States. '
