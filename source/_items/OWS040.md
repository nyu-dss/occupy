description: '*Content Warning: This caption includes description of racial profiling
  and police brutality.* 2011 was the height of NYPDâ€™s stop and frisk tactic as nearly
  700,000 people were stopped and harassed by the cops. Multiple studies have shown
  that, as a result of this policy, people of color were stopped and interrogated
  at a significantly greater rate than white people in New York City. A disconnect
  in Occupy''s rhetoric and actions was palpable to people of color on the frontlines
  at Occupy. On the one hand, Occupy decried police brutality, as this white cloth
  patch that reads "No justice, no peace. End stop and frisk!" suggests. On the other
  hand, as Emahunn Raheem Ali Campbell writes in "A Critique of the Occupy Movement
  from a Black Occupier (The Black Scholar Vol. 41, No. 4, Winter 2011), "I was struck
  by how Occupiers attempted to forge an alliance with the police by chanting, ''We
  are the ninety-nine percent! So are you!'' and ''You are one of us!''"'
