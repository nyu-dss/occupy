description: 'This cardboard sign that reads "Wisconsin, Workers, Students, Thank
  You," references the protests against Act 10 at the Wisconsin State Capitol that
  occurred from February to June 2011. Introduced by Republican Governor Scott Walker,
  Act 10 placed severe limitations on collective bargaining rights for the state''s
  public sector employees and made drastic cuts to their benefits. The law also made
  it illegal for employers to collect union dues from paychecks, even with a worker’s
  consent. Wisconsin’s public sector unions have lost about 70 percent of their members
  since 2011. Activists were able to initiate a recall election in 2012, but Walker
  defeated the Democratic nominee Tom Barrett. The Obama administration did little
  to support Wisconsin activists or Barrett''s campaign in 2011-2012. Walker later
  signed a right-to-work law in 2015, further weakening the influence of unions in
  the state. The protests at the Capitol involved tens of thousands of people, and
  they garnered much attention in labor and left media throughout 2011. Public sector
  workers and other activists sought to link their struggle to a long history of bipartisan
  attacks on unions, particularly since the 1980s. The occupation of the Wisconsin
  State Capitol is now often seen as a precursor to Occupy Wall Street. '

image_description: A raised fist, drawn with yellow and black marker, and with the
  word "We" on the cuff of its shirtsleeve, is at the center of this cardboard sign.
  Surrounding the fist is text that reads "Wisconsin Workers, Educators, Students,
  an Artists Thank You! The word "Wisconsin" is outlined, and in the upper right-hand
  corner of the sign it reads, "Help Support Collective Bargaining, Help Us All!"
  Yellow duct tape covers each of the corners and two pieces of black duct tape are
  folded over the top edge. The backside of the sign shows that it is a cardboard
  box from "Mutual Trading Co, Inc. New York."
