  education multiple-page pamphlet was produced by Queering Occupy Wall Street as
  a way to share language, terms, and framing within the movement. The pamphlet introduces

image_description: 'A multi-page pamphlet, titled the "Queering OWS Radical Language
  Road Guide," is designed in black font on a white page. The pamphlet includes QR
  codes for a Facebook page and the General Assembly website. The inside pages include
  a list of LGBTQIA2S+ terms, and clarifies what the Queering Occupy Wall Street caucus
  means by "queering." The pamphlet ends with a disclaimer that the terms within the
  document "are loose guidelines for understanding important language and successfully
  navigating within queer space." Below this statement is a logo created by Queering
  Occupy that incorporates a transgender symbol as the "O" in Occupy and the use of
  an inverted triangle in the place of the "U" in "Occupy." '
