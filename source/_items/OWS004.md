description: "Queering Occupy Wall Street were a caucus that centered queer lives,
  experiences, and queer-led direct action within Occupy Wall Street. This multi-page
  pamphlet was produced by Queering Occupy Wall Street as a way to share language,
  terms, and framing as a means of political education within Occupy Wall Street.
  The pamphlet introduces the reader to information related to gender sexuality; however,
  its authors uphold a queer politic of autonomy and resist strict defnition. \n\n"

image_description: 'A multi-page pamphlet, titled the "Queering OWS Radical Language
  Road Guide," is designed in black font on a white page. The pamphlet includes QR
  odes for a Facebook page and the General Assembly website. The inside pages include
  a list of LGBTQIA2S+ terms and definitions, and a definition of what the Queering
  Occupy Wall Street caucus means by "queering." The pamphlet ends with a disclaimer
  that the terms within the document "are loose guidelines for understanding important
  lanugage and successfully navigating within queer space."  Below this statement
  is a logo created by Queering Occupy that incorprates a transgender symbol as the
  "O" in Occupy and the use of an inverted triangle in the place of the "U" in "Occupy." '
