description: 'As the Occupy movement grew, some of its discourse matured as well.
  This illustration of four women in hijabs, encourages activists to "decolonize globally"
  and is one of the few documents in the OWS Archives Working Group collection that
  makes the political, rhetorical, and intellectual link between decolonization and
  anti-capitalism. Noting that the that "The 99 % Have No Borders," it is also one
  of the few documents that is indicative of Occupy as not only a national movement,
  but an international movement as well. Somewhat hauntingly, the poster presages
  our current moment with the phrase, "Fight Back World Wide: Capitalism is the Crisis."
  Ten years later, "Capitalism is the Crisis" has become a common refrain in the covid-19
  pandemic. This sign, printed on thin paper—the kind of which is often used for wheat
  pasting—shows evidence that it was likely posted up using tape. During Occupy, it
  was common to see similar political signage affixed to telephone poles, lamp posts,
  and plywood boards outside of construction sites.'
