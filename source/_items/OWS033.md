description: It was not an uncommon site to see a famous musician, actress, or politician
  at Zuccotti. Several months into the movement, autonomous organizers began to create
  events such as this candlelight vigil in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King that was
  held on January 15, 2012. Events such as this were designed to draw attention and
  attendance, and invited participation from individuals who may not have wanted to
  involve themselves in more confrontational direct actions. The vigil began with
  a march that started at St. John the Divine and concluded at Riverside Church where
  the main program was held. Figures such as Patti Smith, Yoko Ono, and Steve Earle
  spoke and performed. Within Occupy, some protestors critiqued this tactic, arguing
  that it perpetuated consumerism and party politics, and opened the door to cooptation
  of the movement.
