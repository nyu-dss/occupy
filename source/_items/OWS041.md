image_description: On a square, white cloth patch, printed in blue ink, the words
  "Stop Climate Chaos!" are silkscreened within a cloud of pollution that pours out
  from a factory. On the front of the factory, which also has the semblance of a bank,
  there is a dollar sign. There are droplets of liquid raining down from the pollution
  cloud, and underneath a wave, formed by human bodies collectively moving together,
  is about to break on top of the polluting factory. Beneath the image is text that
  reads "#FloodWallStreet. At each of the four corners of the cloth there is a safety
  pin, suggesting that this pin was affixed to a piece of clothing.
