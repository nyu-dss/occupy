description: For nearly two weeks in October, Occupy Oakland formed an encampment
  at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza -- renamed by protestors in honor of Oscar Grant -- in Oakland,
  California. In the early dawn hours of October 25, 2011, police raided the camp,
  seriously injuring several including Iraq War Veteran Scott Olsen. The violence
  perpetuated by the police led the American Civil Liberties Union and National Lawyers
  Guild to call for an investigation into the use of excessive force by the Oakland
  Police Department. This solidarity statement was issued by Occupy Wall Street New
  York General Assembly in response to the destruction of Occupy Oakland and the arrest
  and injury of Occupy Oakland activists.
