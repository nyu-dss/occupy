description: 'Cardboard sign that includes a a photograph of South Korean labor activist
  Kim Jin-suk and a message of "Solidarity from 99 Percent of Korea." Kim was a welder
  who received international attention when she staged a protest against her employer
  on top of a 115-foot shipyard crane in 2011. Following massive layoffs, Kim occupied
  the crane for more than 300 days in order to pressure Hanjin Heavy Industries and
  Construction to rehire unionists who had lost their jobs. The protest worked and
  nearly a hundred workers regained their positions as a result of Kim''s protest
  and the movement she inspired across South Korea. Kim''s protest is just one example
  of Occupy linking their actions to other solidarity movements across the globe. '
