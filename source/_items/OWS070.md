description: Kim Jin-suk was a welder, and South Korean labor activist, who received
  international attention when she staged a protest against her employer on top of
  a 115-foot shipyard crane in 2011. Following massive layoffs, Kim occupied the crane
  for more than 300 days in order to pressure Hanjin Heavy Industries and Construction
  to rehire unionists who had lost their jobs. The protest worked. Nearly a hundred
  workers regained their positions as a result of Kim's protest and the movement she
  inspired across South Korea. Kim's protest is just one example of Occupy linking
  their actions to other solidarity movements across the globe. This cardboard sign
  includes a photograph Kim and a message of "Solidarity from 99 Percent of Korea."

image_description: This cardboard sign includes a black and white photograph of South
  Korean labor activist Kim Jin-suk, smiling and raising both her fists in the air.
  To the right of the photograph, a protestor has written in black marker, “Kim, Jinsuk
  (=300 Days) ‘Let’s Fight Together!’” Below this, the sign says, “Solidarity from
  99% of Korea.” At the bottom of the sign it says Suyunomo R (Independent Research
  Commune). There are Hangul characters and a black and white photograph from the
  G20 Seoul Summit in 2010. The back side of the cardboard shows that the cardboard
  comes from a yellow, white, and blue printer paper box. There are crossed out words
  that say 2nd floor (SM) J+K’s Toys” suggesting that this box may previously have
  been used in a household move.
