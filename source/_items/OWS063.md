description: In 2011 and 2012, then Mayor of New York City, Mike Bloomberg, announced
  plans to close thirty-three public schools due to supposed "poor performance." Under
  pressure from its rank and file membership, and with support from Occupy the DOE
  (Department of Education), United Federation of Teachers (UFT) voiced public support
  for Occupy, and allowed Occupy to utilize UFT office spaces. This UFT poster calls
  Mike Bloomberg "The 13 Percent Mayor." 13% refers to an anti-tenure measure, designed
  during Bloomberg's administration, that only allowed 13% of UFT teachers access
  to a due process hearing with an independent body during reviews of supposed "ineffective
  ratings."
