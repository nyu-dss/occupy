description: This flowchart explains how consensus based decision making operated
  at Zuccotti. A critical perspective might question the degree to which real consensus
  was achievable among crowds that sometimes numbered in the thousandsâ€”in particular,
  when communication sometimes relied upon "the people's mic" which was not always
  clear or accurate. Nevertheless, organizers affirmed that consensus decision making
  was a key part of Occupy's horizontal structure. It was understood that consensus
  based decision making would likely be a new concept to many protestors joining the
  movement. Handouts such as this one helped introduce concepts like consensus to
  a wide audience.

image_description: This flowchart, authored by C.T. Lawrence Butler and coming from
  a source called consensus.net, explains how consensus based decision making works.
  The flow chart is broken into three main sections 1. Identify Values 2. Identify
  Concerns 3. Resolve Concerns. The flowchart suggests that a facilitator is meant
  to explain the process, present the issue, and ask questions to clarify. There is
  a marking in the lower right-hand corner that reads "Revised 06/2011." The sheet
  of paper shows crease marks that suggest use by an on-the-ground activist at Occupy.
