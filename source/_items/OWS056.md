description: 'TC Energy commissioned Keystone XL pipeline in 2010 which was supposed
  to stretch from Western Canada to Texas. Indigenous and environmental activists
  soon worked to stop it, making the project a mainstream issue for many progressives
  concerned about pollution and Indigenous rights. The Obama administration temporarily
  delayed the final phase of the pipeline in 2015, but the Trump administration allowed
  the project to continue. After President Biden signed an executive order to stop
  the completion of the pipeline, TC Energy announced its cancellation. This sign
  reads, "No Keystone XL Pipeline." '

image_description: 'Cut out paper letters say, "No Keystone XL Pipeline" on this sign.
  Each of the words, which are set on a yellow background, is a different color: "No"
  is black, "Keystone" is orange, "XL" is pink, and "Pipeline" is red. The sign is
  held together by packing tape which has been layered to create a laminating effect.'
