description: 'Yellow sign that reads "No Keystone XL Pipeline." TC Energy commisoned
  the pipeline in 2010 which was supposed to stretch from Western Canada to Texas.
  Environmental activists soon worked to stop it, making the project a mainstream
  issue for many progressives concerned about pollution and indigenous rights. The
  Obama administration temporarily delayed the final phase of the pipeline in 2015,
  but the Trump administration allowed the project to continue. After President Biden
  signed an executive order to stop the completion of the pipeline, TC Energy announced
  its cancellation. '
