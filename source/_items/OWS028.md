description: Occupy Wall Street's New York City General Assembly (NYCGA) was the decision-making
  body for the movement. As a decision-making body, NYCGA based its principles and
  strategies in anarchist praxis and functioned horizontally, using a modified-consensus-based
  system. In a spokes-council model, the General Assembly was comprised of multiple
  working groups who organized autonomously around issues like access to/distribution
  of food, media and communications, direct action, legal support, and more. The Archives
  Working Group, who donated a large collection of records created during the course
  of the Occupy movement, the records of which comprise this exhibit, were one such
  group at Occupy. The NYCGA took inspiration from similar assemblies that operated
  in Egypt's Tahrir Square and Madrid's Puerta del Sol. The use of the "people's mic,"
  an organic way to amplify speech through repetition, was popularized at the General
  Assembly. This three page, tri-fold pamphlet is a kind of primer to the NYCGA, introducing
  the reader to how the NYCGA operates and inviting the reader to join. In the weeks
  following Occupy's eviction from Zuccotti, joining the GA became more challenging
  as police refused individuals carrying large bags entry into the park. Facilitators
  for the GA began to allow emergency proposals to be made without having them first
  circulate in advance, and activists took to live-tweeting the GA in order to communicate
  broadly.

label: A tri-fold pamphlet introducing the New York City General Assembly
image_description: On the cover of this tri-fold pamphlet is a foregrounded image
  of the Wall Street bull with a dancer pirouetting on its back. Behind the bull,
  in the background, a protest street battle ensues with a haze of teargas and protestors
  wearing gas masks. The pamphlet, produced in black and white, is titled NYC General
  Assembly. In its interior there are two black and white images of protestors holding
  protest signs under a section called "Occupy Wall Street—Background." There is a
  section called “NYC General Assembly—How It Works,” and a third section on the various
  groups that comprise the General Assembly. The final section provides four photographs
  of hand gestures used to communicate during the General Assembly. The back page
  of the pamphlet offers contact information and directions
