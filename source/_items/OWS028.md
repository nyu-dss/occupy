description: 'Occupy Wall Street''s New York General Assembly (NYGA) was the decision-making
  body for individuals engaged in protest activities, including encampment, at Liberty
  Plaza. As a decision-making body, NYGA based its principles and strategies in anarchist
  praxis and functioned horizontally, using a modified-consensus-based system. In
  a spokes-council model, the General Assembly was comprised of multiple working groups
  who organized autonomously around issuse like access to/distribution of food, media
  and communications, direct action, legal support, and more. The Archives Working
  Group, who donated a large collection of records created during the course of the
  Occupy movement, were one such group who focused on archiving and memory work related
  to Occupy. The NYGA took inspiration from similar assemblies that operated in Egypt''s
  Tahrir Square and Madrid''s Puerta del Sol. The use of the "people''s mic," an organic
  way to amplify speech through repetition, was popularized at the General Assembly.
  This three page, tri-fold pamphlet is a kind of primer to the NYGA, introducing
  the reader to how the NYGA operates and inviting the reader to join. '
