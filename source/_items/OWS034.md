description: 'On the one-year anniversary of the movement, Occupy Wall Street held
  a series of demonstrations and actions throughout the financial district. This map
  outlines the planned-for September 17th (S17) actions and demonstration zones. An
  introduction reads, "On September 17th, we will block Wall Street with non-violent
  civil disobedience and flood the area around it with a roving carnival of resistance."
  With a nod to the fact that civil disobedience actions would likely lead to arrests,
  the map also recommends that participants attend a "Know Your Rights" training before
  September 17th. At least 185 protestors were arrested on that day. '
