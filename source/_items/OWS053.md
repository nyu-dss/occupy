description: Masks are commonly used by protestors to conceal their identities, and
  the Guy Fawkes mask was not an uncommon face covering at Occupy. The mask, which
  emulates the historical actor Guy Fawkes, who attempted and failed to assassinate
  the Protestant King James in 1604, was popularized by the 2005 movie V for Vendetta.
  The mask then became the main logo for Anonymous, a well-known hacker group that
  supported Occupy Wall Street and WikiLeaks, among other issues in the early-2010s.
  This cardboard sign features a Guy Fawkes mask and reads "Can't Stop, Won't Stop."
  The back of the sign shows that this was a box that was received at the UPS Store
  on Fulton Street. At the height of Occupy, protestors received as many as 400 boxes
  a day containing various donated supplies for the movement.
