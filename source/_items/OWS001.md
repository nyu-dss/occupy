description: "This flyer was produced by Occupy on Wheels, a disability justice group
  within Occupy that advocated for Occupy Wall Street to be more inclusive to disabled
  people who use wheelchairs. On their still extant social media, Occupy on Wheels
  write, \"OOW (Occupy On Wheels) is dedicated to providing tips to organizers & activists
  on how the occupy movement (and protest events in general) can be more inclusive
  and accessible, and why this is important (and easy!).\" Occupy on Wheels held regular
  teach-ins on accessibility within social justice movements, and continued to support
  movement work, by creating and supporting new disability justice outreach projects
  throughout NYC, for several years following the end of Occupy.  \n\n"

image_description: 'The flyer is bright green, and reads "Occupy on Wheels. Awareness.
  Inclusion. Solidarity." Below this text heading there are two squares. Both are
  line drawings of buildings: the one on the left has a step, making it inaccessible
  to a person in a wheelchair. The drawings are captioned, "It only takes one step
  to prevent an activist in a wheelchair from getting into a building. It only takes
  one step to make sure this doesn''t happen at your event."'
