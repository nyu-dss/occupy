description: "This flyer was produced by Occupy on Wheels, a disability justice group
  within Occupy that advocated for Occupy Wall Street to be more inclusive to disabled
  people. On their still extant social media, Occupy on Wheels write, \"OOW (Occupy
  On Wheels) is dedicated to providing tips to organizers & activists on how the Occupy
  movement (and protest events in general) can be more inclusive and accessible, and
  why this is important (and easy!).\" Occupy on Wheels held regular teach-ins on
  accessibility within social justice movements, and continued to support movement
  work, by creating and supporting new disability justice outreach projects throughout
  NYC, for several years following the end of Occupy. \n"

label: Occupy on Wheels flyer calling for a more accessible movement
image_description: 'The flyer is bright green, and reads "Occupy on Wheels. Awareness.
  Inclusion. Solidarity." Below this text heading there are two squares. Both are
  line drawings of buildings: the one on the left has a step, making it inaccessible
  to a person in a wheelchair. The drawings are captioned, "It only takes one step
  to prevent an activist in a wheelchair from getting into a building. It only takes
  one step to make sure this doesn''t happen at your event."'
