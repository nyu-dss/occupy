description: This pamphlet welcomes newcomers of the Occupy Movement to Liberty Plaza,
  the main site of public space occupation in New York City, also known as Zucotti
  Park. The pamphlet is written in the humerous tone of a travel brochure, and provides
  a list of various committees one can join, a guide to attending general assembly
  (GA) meetings inclusive of hand signals used in the meeting, and a description of
  "accommodations" such as where to source food, where to use the restroom, and few
  tips for "extended stays." The a tongue-in-cheek tone of the pamphlet may be interpreted
  both as a critique of the fact that, after several months, Occupy Wall Street was
  a kind spectacle to some, a space that even tourists "visited." At the same time,
  the pamphlet is an invitation for all to join in the movement.
