description: 'Founded in 1999, Transgender Day of Remembrance memorializes transgender
  people who were murdered due to transphobia. The day is observed annually on November
  20th. This flyer amplifies Trans Day of Remembrance and calls for trans awareness
  as a part of Occupy Wall Street. Queering Occupy organized the event which was held,
  preceding the national Day of Remembrance, at Liberty Plaza on November 13, 2011.
  The group was just one of several at Zuccotti that sought to carve out a space to
  address misogyny, transphobia, cissexism, and homophobia both within the movement
  and as larger societal issues. '
