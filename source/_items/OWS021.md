description: From demonstration accompaniment by radical marching bands like the Rude
  Mechanical Orchestra to performances at Zuccotti by musicians like Tom Morello,
  David Crosby, Graham Nash, Talib Kweli, and Pete Seeger, music was an integral part
  of the Occupy Wall Street movement. In this photograph, a trombonist plays their
  instrument. The slide of their trombone has been turned into a protest sign that
  reads "Tax the Rich," calling attention to the anti-capitalist roots of the Occupy
  Wall Street movement. The photograph has been cropped by the curators to protect
  the identity of the trombonist.
