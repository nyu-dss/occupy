description: From drumming circles to demonstration accompanyment by radical marching
  bands like the Rude Mechanical Orchestra to performances at Zuccotti by musicians
  like Tom Morello, David Crosby, Graham Nash, Talib Kweli, and Pete Seeger, music
  was an integral part of the Occupy Wall Street movement. In this photograph, a trombonist
  plays their instrument. The slide of their trombone has been turned into an protest
  sign that reads "Tax the Rich," calling attention to the anti-capitalist roots of
  the Occupy Wall Street Movement. The photograph has been cropped by the curators
  to protect the identities of the individuals carrying the banner.
