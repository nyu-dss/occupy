description: 'The largest student strike in Québec and Canada''s histories occurred
  during 2012, lasting from February 12th through September 7th. In what the media
  dubbed "the Maple Spring," students in Québec went on strike following the provincial
  government''s increase of student tuition by 75%. The government responded by enacting
  Bill 12, also called Bill 78, which pressured students to end their demonstrations
  by enacting provisions that forced students to return to their coursework and limited
  their rights to protest. Students in the United States took inspiration from the
  actions of the Québec student strike, and brought similar critiques about the corporatization
  of higher education, untenable tuition and fees, rising student debt, and the need
  for free education. Strikers and their supporters, would affix a small red square
  (attached to this card with a safety pin) to show their solidarity for the movement.
  The card makes note that every Wednesday evening is a casseroles protest, and it
  requests that protestors bring pots and pans "to make some noise!" Cacerolazo, also
  called caserolada, is a form of protest popular around the world, though predominantly
  in South America, where protestors create a sonic disturbance by banging pots, pans,
  and utensils together. Noisemaking has a long tradition in protest, inclusive of
  the use of song, protest bands, and noise demos outside of carceral sites. The casserole
  invites wide participation as the noisemakers it requires are materials that are
  often easily found or borrowed. '
