description: "The largest student strike in Québec and Canada's historied occurred
  during 2012, lasting from February 12, 2012 through September 7, 2012. In what the
  media dubbed \"the Maple Spring,\" students in Québec went on strike following the
  provincial government's increase of student tution by 75%. The goverment responded
  by enacting Bill 12, also called Billed 78, which pressured students to end their
  demonstrations by enacting provisions that forced students to return to their coursework
  and limited their rights to protest. Students in the United States took inspiration
  from the actions of the Québec student strike, and brought similar critiques about
  the corporatization of higher education, untenable tuitiion and fees, rising student
  debt, and the need for free education. Strikers and their supporters, would affix
  a small red square (attached to this card with a safety pin) to show their solidarity
  for the movement. The card makes note that every Wednesday evening is a casseroles
  protest and requests that protestors bring pots and pans \"to make some noise!\"
  Cacerolazo, also called caserolada or casserole is a form of protest popular around
  the world, though predominantly in South America, where protestors call attention
  to their cause, and create a sonic disturbance, by banging pots, pans, and utensils
  together. Noisemaking has a long tradition in protest, inclusive of the use of song,
  protest bands, and noise demos outside of carceral sites. The casserole invites
  wide participation as the noisemakers it requires are materials often easily found
  or borrowed. \n"
