description: 'This poster board protest sign, with the phrase "Turmoil Over Oil" at
  its center, names many of the chief concerns of Occupy: health care, the prison
  industrial complex, ceaseless wars, police brutality, and banker greed. The text
  appears to have been written by more than one contributor and includes one note
  which veers into the conspiratorial: "Gov Assassination List." In this way, the
  sign functions as a visual representation of Occupy as a kind of "big umbrella"
  movement. At its center were commonly held beliefs, principles, and shared ideologies;
  however, there were ideas at the fringes of the movement that often sparked intra-movement
  debates and fueled tension between activists. It is not surprising that, in the
  aftermath of Occupy, several activists who gained prominence for their outspokenness
  on social media, their willingness to be quoted by journalists, or their general
  visibility have since joined white nationalist, alt-right, and conservative movements. '

image_description: 'In black and red marker, the sign says in large font, "Turmoil
  Over War." Surrounding and overlapping this text are other words and phrases like
  "entrapment," "prison industrial complex," "lobbying," and "surveillance." The surrounding
  words are all written in varying handwriting, suggesting that they have each been
  written by different people. The opposite side of the sign, in red and blue marker,
  the text says, "This Is Not A War on Terror It''s A War in Error!!!" '
