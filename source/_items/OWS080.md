description: 'This blue foam hand, raising its middle finger with text that reads
  "tax dodgers 1%," references the major issue of corporate tax avoidance. Prior to
  the Occupy movement, a group called US Uncut placed a spotlight on offshore banking
  and tax shelters utilized by corporations to hide trillions of dollars in revenues.
  US Uncut and Occupy intersected over the issue of corporate greed, and many US Uncut
  activists joined Occupy direct actions. '
