description: Though Occupy took its anti-capitalist roots seriously, protestors also
  found space for humor in the movement. This sign reads, "Eat the Rich, They're Very
  Tender Cause They Don't Work."

label: '"Eat the Rich" protest sign'
image_description: '"Eat the Rich" is drawn in red capitalized letters on a cardboard
  box. To the right of the word "The" is a peace sign colored in yellow, green, and
  red. Beginning at the top of the sign and continuing along the right edge, the sign
  reads "They''re very tender cause they don''t work!!!" Very is underlined in red.
  The backside of the sign is the top of the pizza box, indicating that the pizza
  was from a pizza shop called L''asso on Mott Street. The pizza box is white, with
  a red, yellow, and green design. A protestor has written "cigarettes?" across this
  side in black marker. In an unintentional echo of the front of the sign, in the
  bottom right corner of the pizza box lid, there is an eye with text underneath that
  says, "eat the pizza." The top of the pizza box shows footprints indicating that
  the sign was walked on.'
