description: 'Established artists like Shepard Fairey and Martha Colburn produced
  works in response to the movement, but Occupy also sought to bring art to the 99%
  and uplift art made by the 99%. Occupy was keenly aware of the power of culture
  and art to make social change, and the Arts and Culture Working Group worked to
  organize the creative potential within the movement. They held sign-making gatherings,
  created puppets and props for actions, painted banners, and hosted a range of performances.
  This sign for the Arts and Culture Center at Zuccotti gives the message "Art is
  for your voices" on its back side. '

image_description: 'On the front side of this brightly colored poster, the letters
  OWS! are in yellow and they are set on a red background that has purposefully jagged
  edges reminiscent of a cartoon action bubble. Index cards, that are affixed to the
  back of the poster, peak out along the bottom edge, as do pieces of tape. On the
  back side, the poster is stabilized with a piece of cardboard, and there are six
  index-card sized pieces of paper in pink, green, and purple. The cards read: "This
  is the Arts and Culture Center," "Help us Stay and Continue/to Express," "Ourselves.
  Please (underlined) clean up after yourselves," "We must keep clean to be allowed
  to stay!," "I love you all more than water Art is for your voices!," "Please please
  put materials back in their proper home!," "Lovely humans with lovely hearts."'
