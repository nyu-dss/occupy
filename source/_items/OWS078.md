description: "*Content Warning: This caption includes description of the state sanctioned
  murder of Black individuals in the United States.* On February 26, 2012, 17-year-old
  Trayvon Benjamin Martin was murdered by George Zimmerman in Sanford, Florida. Shortly
  after Zimmerman racially profiled Trayvon and called the police, Zimmerman shot
  and killed Martin. Zimmerman was acquitted by a jury of second-degree murder and
  manslaughter charges in July, 2013. Martin's death became a national story, sparked
  protests across the nation in 2012 and 2013, and brought renewed attention to issues
  surrounding racial profiling and the justice system. This included Occupy Wall Street
  activists who organized rallies in honor of Martin during the spring of 2012. "
