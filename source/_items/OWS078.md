  On February 26, 17-year-old Travyon Benjamin Martin was murdered by George Zimmerman
  in Sanford, Florida. Shortly after he called the police, the two had a physical
  altercation which led to Zimmerman shooting and killing Martin. Zimmerman was acquitted
  by a jury of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges in July 2013. Martin''s
  death became a national story, sparked protests across the nation in 2012 and 2013,
  and brought renewed attention to issues surrounding racial profiling and the justice
  system. This included Occupy Wall Street activists who organized rallies in honor
  of Martin during the spring of 2012. '
