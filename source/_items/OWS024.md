description: 'The practice of jail support is one that social movements have employed
  for decades. It ensures that arrestees have adequate support and it can include
  actions such as: having someone on the outside tracking an arrestee through the
  system; fellow protestors awaiting an arrestee''s release and providing food and
  clothing upon their release; establishing a ride home for newly released arrestees;
  and organizing any other necessities for those who have been arrested. Over the
  course of the Occupy movement, thousands of protesters were arrested, and jail support
  was a key expression of solidarity. This document provides an introduction to jail
  support. Described as a "show of solidarity with fellow activists," the guide helps
  explain how to mobilize at "SIS" (52 Broadway) and collect information to give to
  the National Lawyers Guild. 52 Broadway was where OWS had temporary storage space
  and is also the location of the United Federation of Teachers'' headquarters.'
