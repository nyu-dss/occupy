description: 'On the ground, Occupy activists were constantly discussing how to deal
  with various logistical issues as their movement expanded. They sometimes communicated
  their frustrations, to the world and one another, through protest signage. This
  cardboard sign, which is both tongue-in-cheek and also offers an underlying critique
  of the movement, expresses some of these frustrations and reads, "Occupy spends
  $4,000 a week on photocopies but still cannot buy a coffee machine that keeps the
  protesters warm, happy, and ready to protest." '

image_description: On a torn and flattened cardboard box, a protestor has handwritten
  in black marker, "Occupy spends $4,000 a week on photocopies, but still cannot buy
  a coffee machine that keeps the protesters warm, happy, and ready to protest." The
  back side of the sign shows that this cardboard box was originally for vinyl examination
  gloves.
