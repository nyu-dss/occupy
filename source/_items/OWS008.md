description: NYU4OWS was a group of NYU undergraduate and graduate students who came
  together in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street in October of 2011. According to
  their Facebook page, last updated in 2015, NYU4OWS "was founded to organize the
  NYU community around issues raised by Occupy Wall Street and to highlight the connections
  between NYU and Wall Street...Our organization is made up of students at NYU who
  believe our university should be an institution governed by students, faculty, staff
  and community members. We believe NYU should be a university that stands up and
  fights for human rights, including the right to education, housing and work with
  dignity." The group organized with students from CUNY, the New School, Columbia
  and other schools in the city to hold the All-City Student Assembly weekly in Washington
  Square Park; they held the People's U, a series of lectures by faculty, students,
  and activists to bring free political education to the public; they coordinated
  and led walk-outs and marches; and they produced literature such as this pamphlet.
  In this pamphlet, NYU4OWS uncovers the University's ties to Wall Street and calls
  upon students to join the OWS movement.
