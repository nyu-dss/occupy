description: 'The OWS Town Planning group was interested in counting how many people
  were camping overnight at Zuccotti Park in order to "improve the space for all of
  us." This sheet was taped to the front of tents inside of Zuccotti Park. Keeping
  protestors safe became an increasing concern for organizers as the camp grew in
  October and November. '

label: Handout to indicate whether or not a tent is occupied
image_description: This small, typewritten handout asks "Is This Tent Being Occupied"
  and â€œHow Many People?" The handout is marked off as "Yes" and "3" in a purple pen.
  There is also a red piece of duct tape attached to the sheet and a note from the
  OWS Town Planning committee that the sheet will be collected in the next 24 hours.
  The handout shows the wear of having been outside. It is crisscrossed with dirty
  creases and the ink has smeared as if it has gotten wet.
