description: Flight attendants took a 35% pay cut in order to save jobs in the wake
  of 9/11. American Airlines told their workers that they would increase their retirement
  and health benefits, but did not follow through on their promises. This sign calls
  attention to this issue and demands that American Airlines restore Flight Attendants
  wages.

image_description: '"Restore American Airlines Flight Attendants Wages" is written
  in multi-color bubble letters. A yellow star is drawn in the center of the sign.
  The sign is made from a cardboard box. The backside of cardboard sign shows that
  this was a box from Scott, Foresman, and Company. It is stamped "books." On it,
  someone has written in black marker "Glass Hostess Set" and a strip of masking tape
  runs down the right side. "Heavy" is written on the masking tape with black marker,
  indicating that this was a box that may have been used in a household move.'
