description: 'This handwritten page, torn from a notebook, lists some of the logistical
  issues that organizers faced during Occupy: documentation via live streamers, organizing
  a kitchen, having legal representation, the need for media representatives, and
  accounting for medical issues and garbage/sanitation. It is unclear what action
  this logistical list references; however, the heading "Occupy the Landscape" may
  be in relation to a 22-mile protest march that took place in the state of New York.
  Regardless of the specific action, this notebook page is demonstrative of the activistsâ€™
  real-time decision making during the movement.'
