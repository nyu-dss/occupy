description: 'A carboard sign, formed from a pizza box, announcing an upcoming street
  medic training from 2:00-7:00 PM. The location is listed as "TBA," but the group
  was planning to meet and leave from the medic station. National Nurses United (NNU)
  helped Occupy set up its main medical station for protesters in October 2011. NNU
  set up similar tents for Occupy in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington. In
  NYC, Mayor Bloomberg, the NYPD and other city officials attempted to close down
  the medical station, but they were repeatedly prevented from doing so by a group
  of NNU nurses and Occupy activities locking arms. '
