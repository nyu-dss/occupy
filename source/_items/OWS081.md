description: Freedom of Information Act files obtained by various journalists, civil
  rights groups, and lawyers indicate that the FBI conducted high levels of surveillance
  against the Occupy movement, and that the movement was being watched as early as
  August, 2011. Protesters were largely aware of this fact, and—while security culture
  was not meaningfully employed in the movement—they aimed to keep one another aware,
  and perhaps also desired to let the feds know that they were aware as well.

image_description: A hand drawing of a surveillance van, disguised as a "Joe's Pizza"
  delivery vehicle, is at the top of this protest sign. The sign says "Smile" with
  smiley faces drawn on either side of the word. Below this, the text of the sign
  reads, "that white van behind you is gathering all sorts of info about you, possibly
  even taking scans of your naked body, similar to the airport body scanners." The
  sign is written in thin black marker.
