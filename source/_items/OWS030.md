  As the Occupy Wall Street movement grew, it was critiqued by Indigenous people for
  the ways its framing and language ignored legacies, and ongoing enactments, of colonialism.
  On September 24th, John Paul Montano, an Anishnaabe writer and teacher of Nishnaabe
  language, wrote an open letter to Occupy Wall Street addressing these issues, in
  particular: a lack of recognition that the protest was taking place on Indigenous
  lands, and that the phrase "99%" was not inclusive of Indigenous experiences. Indigenous
  activist, and founder of the Native Youth Sexual Health Network, Jessica Yee wrote
  a piece on the now inoperative website Racialicious, arguing that use of the terms
  "occupy" and "occupier" reinforced settler colonial thinking and were an erasure
  of Indigenous presence. Shortly after these criticisms were publicized, Indigenous
  activists, inclusive of community members from the Owe Aku International Justice
  Project, First Voice Indigenous Radio, and the United Confederation of the Taino
  People, circulated this flyer calling for solidarity with Indigenous people and
  abolishing Columbus Day. The groups who created the flyer state that they will "bring
  their voices to Occupy Wall Street" and call for a meeting at the Southeast corner
  of Zuccotti Park. The meeting was a part of a broader conversation regarding the
  tactic of encampment and Indigenous movementsâ€™ critiques of Occupy''s failure to
  address settler colonialism within the movement.'
