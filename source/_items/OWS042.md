description: 'In the wake of the 2008 recession that led to approximately 10 million
  people losing their homes, Occupy sought to bring renewed attention to housing justice.
  After a period of widespread predatory lending and unregulated markets, the federal
  government did little to combat the growing housing crisis in the United States.
  After the 2008 market crash, home values plummeted across the country, and homeowners
  who were the victims of predatory lending found themselves in the position of having
  outstanding loans with a higher principle than the market value of their house.
  This was what was known as an "underwater mortgage." Occupy called attention to
  these issues, holding rallies in support of homeowners at risk of losing their homes. '

  calling for "principal reductions for underwater loans." The flyer states that the

  Wharf *bring your swimsuit!"
