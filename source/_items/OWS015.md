description: '*Content Warning: This caption includes description of transphobia and
  cissexism* This statement, titled "OWS Must Resist Cis-Supremacy and Trans Misogyny,"
  and signed by "a bunch of trans women occupiers," calls for accountability within
  Occupy Wall Street. The statement, which was first circulated online, and was later
  printed as a flyer to be distributed in-person, followed the November 9th General
  Assembly. During this meeting, members from the Queering OWS Caucus were disrupted
  by trans-exclusionary feminist groups, Women Occupying Nations and Strong Women,
  while the Queering OWS Caucus spoke out about issues of sexual assault and racism
  within the movement. The statement reminds readers that the "elimination of systemic
  oppression against marginalized people is a core goal of the Occupy movement" and
  calls for trans-exclusionary groups to be blocked from participation in the New
  York General Assembly. Citing their significant contributions to the movement, including
  the "creation and operation of OccupyWallSt.org," the signers note that they "are
  prepared to leave the New York General Assembly and its empowered Spokes Council
  en masse if trans-excluding groups, spaces, and individuals continue to be tolerated
  by this body.‚Äù The signers also demand the adoption of a trans-inclusive safer spaces
  policy. After the release of this statement, in December 2011, activist, artist,
  and filmmaker Tourmaline wrote "An Open Letter for Gender Self-Determination in/at
  OWS" in the first issue of Post Post Script, a publication which circulated during
  Occupy. Tourmaline states, "As long as there has been trans leadership, particularly
  trans women leadership, in movements for self-determination, we have faced resistance
  and ejection from the very movements we have helped to make." Tourmaline reminds
  the reader that Occupy Wall Street is repeating the harms of the 1973 Washington
  Square Rally, during which organizers allowed Lesbian Feminist Liberation to remove
  Sylvia Rivera, a trans woman activist, from speaking. Tourmaline closes her note
  by saying "I want to remind each other with love that an investment in biologically
  determined gender is an investment in identities that were violently imposed on
  our bodies in order to maintain capitalism, white supremacy, and colonialism. That
  is why it is not good enough to just have non-trans queer women, gender queer people,
  and trans men in these spaces and claim them as trans affirming. That is why it
  is not OK to non-consensually gender other people. That is why we must support the
  leadership of those who have faced historical exile and isolation from feminist
  and queer space. And that is the reason why being trans, gender-non-conforming,
  and queer are anti-capitalist acts." '
