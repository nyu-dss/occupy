description: Student debt surpassed credit card debt in 2010, amounting to more than
  $1 trillion. The average 2011 college graduate had $27,204 in student debt. As a
  movement concerned with economic disparities, student debt was a key issue at Occupy.
  This cardboard sign, created by an NYU student, notes that after just one semester
  they are already $5,000 in debt.
