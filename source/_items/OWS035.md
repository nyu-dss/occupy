description: Though the mainstream media perpetuated a narrative of Occupy Wall Street
  as a disorganized and leaderless movement, this meeting agenda, in preparation for
  the September 17th (S17) actions, demonstrates the kind of planning and communication
  that was behind Occupy's direct action campaigns. The evening meeting was held at
  Judson Memorial Church, less than two miles north of Zuccotti, and is light heartedly
  titled "The Most Awesome Last S17 Monday Meeting Agenda Ever."

image_description: This is a two-sided flyer. It uses white text on a black background.
  The flyer provides texts that notes "We are not trying to return to Zuccotti Park"
  and instead offers lessons, strategy, and ideas learned in the first two months
  of the Occupy Wall Street encampment. The flyer incorporates images of bodies including
  the outline of a human form in white; a head, in profile, in black; a body with
  its arms reaching upwards; and two raised fists that are shackled by handcuffs.
