description: 'Following the 2008 financial crash, many Americans lost more than 20
  percent of their retirement funds. As investment portfolios plummeted, some workers—who
  were recently retired or nearing retirement—had to return to, or stay in, the workforce.
  This sign reveals much of the anxiety and anger around this issue. '

image_description: This hand drawn sign on poster board reads, "When a piece of crap
  takes a crap, and that crap throws up, then the throw up takes a crap, that's a
  401K." Some of the letters are in different colors. The back side of the sign says
  the same message, but it has been completely crossed out with black marker.
