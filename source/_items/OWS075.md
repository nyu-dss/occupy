description: A bright, neon sign with a bear claw reads "Claw back Wall Street bonuses."
  Americans were enraged after it became public that corporations that received bailout
  money in 2009 from the federal government were also giving sizable bonuses to its
  employees, including high-ranking executives. The Obama White House and many leading
  politicians publicly criticized the bonus payments, but the federal government took
  no action to recoup or tax the bonuses.

image_description: A bright, neon sign with a bear claw reads, "Claw back Wall St.
  bonuses." The text and the bear claw are in black and appear to have been cut out
  of paper and affixed to the sign using strips of packing tape to create a laminating
  effect. The "S" in "St." has been transformed into a dollar sign. The bear claw
  reaches out across the bottom of the sign and underneath it are five green dollar
  signs.
