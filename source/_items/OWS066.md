  This sign, which reads, "Safer Spaces: Rapists Fuck Off," calls attention to the
  fact that activist circles are not immune to abuse. As Occupy called out institutional
  violence, within the movement, Occupy struggled against interpersonal violence,
  rape, sexual assault, unwanted touching, transphobic and sexist remarks, and cat-calling.
  In the final weeks of the encampment, organizers attempted to confront the issue,
  and—in a statement released by one survivor''s support team—pushed back against
  the media’s attempts to discredit the movement. The statement notes that "OWS exists
  within a broader culture where sexual assault is egregiously common." The activists
  reinforced that "we have the responsibility and the opportunity to create an alternative
  to this culture of violence," and they worked towards this by creating the Safer
  Spaces Working Group; operating a community watch; offering self-defense training;
  seeking facilitation from Support New York, a transformative justice and survivor
  support collective who lead accountability processes; and building a 16 square foot
  "safe house" designed to shelter thirty women. '
