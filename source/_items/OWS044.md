description: The front cover of The Occupied Wall Street Journal, Issue 4, features
  dozens of slogans from the OWS movement such as "People Before Profit" and "The
  Crisis is Capitalism." The cover attempts to bring together some of the logos and
  phrases that were a part of Occupy's protest sign culture at Zuccotti. The Occupied
  Wall Street Journal was just one of many independent publications and websites that
  were created during the fall of 2011. A new generation of left media emerged in
  the wake of Occupy.
