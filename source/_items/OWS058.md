description: "Sign that reads \"Paul Robeson High School Unite!\" The sign is one
  of several in the collection from local New York City high schools. \n\nStudents
  at Robeson High School organized a student walkout on May 1, 2012 in solidarity
  with the call from Occupy Wall Street to host actions on May Day. 150 students from
  Robeson, Brooklyn Tech and Fort Greene Park High school met at Fort Greene Park
  on May 1. They hosted teach-ins that focused on the connections between Occupy,
  the recent death of Trayvon Martin, and the over policing of their communities and
  the privitization of their public school system. Their school was one of more than
  100 that were closed down due to the education policies of the Bloomberg administration.
  The NYC Department of Education voted to close Robeson in 2011, but allowed students
  to remain until 2014. The students also called for free GED classes and greater
  diversity in terms of their history education. \"We're not out here to play around.
  Let's make a change--knowledge is power, we're out here to learn,\" said one student
  who organized the rally. \n\n"
