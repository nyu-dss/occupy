description: 'Students at Robeson High School organized a student walkout on May 1,
  2012 in solidarity with the call from Occupy Wall Street to host actions on May
  Day. 150 students from Robeson, Brooklyn Tech and Fort Greene Park High school met
  at Fort Greene Park on May 1. They hosted teach-ins that focused on the connections
  between Occupy, the recent death of Trayvon Martin, the over-policing of their communities,
  and the privatization of their public school system. The students also called for
  free GED classes and greater diversity in terms of their history education. "We''re
  not out here to play around. Let''s make a changeâ€”knowledge is power, we''re out
  here to learn," said one student who organized the rally. Their school was one of
  more than 100 that were closed down due to the education policies of the Bloomberg
  administration. The NYC Department of Education voted to close Robeson in 2011,
  but allowed students to remain until 2014.
