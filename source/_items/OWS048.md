description: Local 108 was just one of many union locals present at Occupy Wall Street.
  OWS's Labor Outreach Committee helped build connections with NYC labor, leading
  to greater working class participation in the protests. In this protest sign that
  read "Wall Street May Have Money and Influence BUT The People Got the Power!" and
  "LiUNA," Laborers Local 108 show their solidarity with Occupy.
