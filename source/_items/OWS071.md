description: 'This cardboard reads "Racism is strictly forbidden here" and affixed
  to the sign is a sticker that reads "Occupy Central Park." The sticker advertises
  a demonstration that was set to take place on November 11, 2011. Although Occupy
  encouraged a new wave of class analysis, participants called attention to the whiteness
  of Occupy, acknowledging racism within the movement, and sought to develop more
  connections with people of color-led anti-racist movements in New York City and
  across the country. '
