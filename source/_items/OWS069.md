description: Health care reform became one of Occupy's signature issues, and activists
  called attention to the greed of pharmaceutical companies, insurance companies,
  and medical device companies who prioritized profits over wellness. The Affordable
  Care Act was passed in 2010, but progressive and left activists continued to push
  for universal health care during the Obama years and beyond, especially as many
  companies began to shed, and continue to constrain, employer-supplied benefits.
  In the midst of the growing health care crisis in the United States, hospitals across
  the country were closing. In New York City, St. Vincent's Hospital—which notably
  was the center of NYC's AIDS epidemic, was one of the first hospitals to address
  and treat HIV and AIDS in the nation, and operated one of the most established HIV
  treatment programs—fell into bankruptcy and closed in 2010. Developers quickly moved
  in to capitalize on the property, and in 2015, the Greenwich Lane condominium complex—built
  on the former St. Vincent's Hospital campus— sold its first units for $19,528,202.36
  and $16,320,623.57.
