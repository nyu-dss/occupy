description: 'A posterboard sign that reads "Restructure mortgages. Keep Americans
  in their homes"  In the wake of the 2008 recession that led to approximately 10
  million people losing their homes, Occupy sought to bring renewed attention to how
  the American working class had suffered from a period of widespread predatory lending
  and unregulated markets. While the big banks received large bailouts, the Obama
  administration did little to halt the nation''s foreclosure crisis in 2009. '
