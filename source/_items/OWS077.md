description: 'In the wake of the 2008 recession, which led to approximately 10 million
  people losing their homes, Occupy brought renewed attention to how the American
  working class had suffered from widespread predatory lending and unregulated markets.
  As an example, this sign created by an Occupy protestor makes the demand: "Restructure
  mortgages. Keep Americans in their homes." While the big banks received large bailouts,
  the Obama administration did little to halt the nation''s foreclosure crisis in
  2009. '
