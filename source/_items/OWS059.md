description: 'This collective agreement for Occupy''s office space at 50 Broadway,
  the United Federation of Teacher''s headquarters in lower Manhattan, was written
  by the Occupied Office Coordinator Team. It lists a few guidelines for use of this
  indoor space. Using the logo of the television show The Office, the document asks
  organizers to "respect each other and our hosts/allies at the UFT." It tells activists
  that the space cannot be used for sleeping or personal storage, and it also warns
  that there is zero tolerance for violence, drugs, and abuse of shared property.
  Violating these rules would result in a 30-day suspension from the building, and
  an eventual review of an individual''s standing with the office. '

image_description: 'Using the logo of the television show "The Office," this collective
  agreement asks organizers to "respect each other and our hosts/allies at the UFT."
  A list of rules follows under three main headings: We are here to work and collaborate
  for Occupy Wall Street Working Groups and affiliated projects; We take care of each
  other and this space; and We respect each other and our hosts/allies at the UFT.
  At the bottom of the agreement is smaller font which states that "anyone who breaks
  a zero tolerance code of conduct will not be granted access into the office for
  30 days." The agreement has been laminated, likely in order to ensure its durability.'
