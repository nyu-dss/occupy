  They Can Join Us." Ten years after the attacks on September 11, 2011, there were
  still almost 100,000 US troops in Afghanistan, along with thousands more in Iraq.
  Numerous antiwar veterans participated in Occupy Wall Street, including members
  of Iraq Veterans Against the War (recently renamed About Face). In Oakland,an antiwar
  veteran Scott Olsen suffered a fractured skull, a broken neck, and brain swelling
  after he struck by a police projectile during an attack on protesters. In 2014,
  the city of Oakland agreed to pay Olsen $4.5 million after he sued the Oakland Police
  Department. '
