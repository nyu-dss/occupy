description: Ten years after the attacks on September 11, 2011, there were still almost
  one hundred thousand United States troops in Afghanistan, along with thousands more
  in Iraq. Numerous anti-war veterans participated in Occupy Wall Street, including
  members of Iraq Veterans Against the War (since renamed About Face). In Oakland,
  an anti-war veteran, Scott Olsen, suffered a fractured skull, a broken neck, and
  brain swelling after he was struck by a police projectile during an attack on protesters.
  The sign's red, white, and blue aesthetic, coupled with the message it gives on
  one side, "The Silent Majority Are Silent No More,” reveals a conservative undercurrent
  to the sign. The silent majority, a term first popularized by Richard Nixon, refers
  to a large body of people in a country, or in any group, who do not publicly express
  their opinions. It is language that has largely been adopted on the right, and has
  been echoed by Ronald Reagan, Rudy Giuliani, Michael Bloomberg, and Donald Trump.
  In this way, this sign is perhaps another example of how the left and right collided
  at Occupy, presumably under the shared populist rhetoric of “the 99%.”
