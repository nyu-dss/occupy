description: "*Content Warning: This caption includes description of the state sanctioned
  murder of Black individuals in the United States.* This flyer is for two protests
  in honor of Ramarley Graham that were held just before his funeral in the Bronx.
  Graham was killed by New York police officer, Richard Haste, who stormed into his
  grandmother's apartment and shot him in the chest on February 2, 2012. The flyer
  informs readers that Graham was unarmed, and that the police did not have a warrant
  to enter his family's home. Officers spotted Graham at a bodega near his home and
  thought he was carrying a gun because he adjusted his waistband. Officers reported
  that Graham ran to his grandmother's apartment after they talked to him, but surveillance
  footage showed that he slowly walked back to the residential building."
