description: 'Authored just six days into the encampment, on September 23, 2011, the
  Principles of Solidarity—later coupled with the Declaration of the Occupation of
  New York City—served as a kind of manifesto for the movement. The Principles were
  created by the Working Group on Principles of Consolidation and were circulated
  online after the New York City General Assembly came to consensus on their language
  and shape. Here, an early draft shows the Principles in their nascent state: a rough
  outline and handwritten markings. '

image_description: 'This early draft of the principles of solidarity is typescript
  in black ink on a white page. The statement is structured into three parts: a preamble,
  a section called "we believe" with a list of principles, and a conclusion. There
  are proposed edits in red ink, with words and phrases like "respect" and "wall street
  culture" circled, and "redistributed" underlined. The phrase "confronting our addictions"
  is edited to read "confronting our consumerism," and principle number 2 is edited
  from "We believe in personal responsibility and accountability" to "mutual responsibility."'
