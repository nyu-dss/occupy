description: In the years immediately following the 2008 financial crisis, unemployment
  rates reached the highest they had been in more than two decades. Working class
  people struggled to make ends meet while CEOs received payouts and bonuses. Protest
  signs, such as this one which reads, "I'm a union ironworker. I vote. I work. I
  pay taxes. I'm pissed. So I'm here. All the way from LA," illuminate working class
  solidarity, frustration, and anger.
