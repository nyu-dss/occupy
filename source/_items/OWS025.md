  Following a review period, they would then get a confirmation of having a place
  on the agenda before presenting their proposal. This handout provides guidance on
  how to participate and includes a handwritten note that tells activists that "an
  emergency proposal must have an external deadline that was not previously knowable."
  The second page is a proposal form that individuals could drop off at the Info Desk
