description: The General Assembly was Occupy Wall Street's daily "people's assembly"
  which gathered each night at 7 PM to make collective decisions. As a form of direct
  democracy that aimed to achieve consensus among those gathered, participants in
  the GA were encouraged to develop a proposal, seek relevant input, and then submit
  the proposal to facilitation. Following a review period, they would then get a confirmation
  of having a place on the agenda before presenting their proposal. Recognizing that
  white male voices were becoming overly representative at general assemblies, Occupy
  began utilizing a progressive stack model which pushed issues raised by, for example,
  people of color and women to the front of the agenda. This handout provides guidance
  on how to participate and includes a handwritten note that tells activists that
  "an emergency proposal must have an external deadline that was not previously knowable."
  The second page is a proposal form that individuals could drop off at the Info Desk
  or at the Facilitation Table at Liberty Plaza. In spite of methods of organizing
  and providing structure to the general assemblies, these public meetings were at
  times difficult, and were derailed by any number of causes, from tangential points
  of information to people who were unsympathetic to Occupy.
