description: '*Content Warning: This caption includes description of racial profiling
  and police violence.* As Occupy solidified its positions and tactics, it became
  more clear in addressing the broken system of racial capitalism as a whole. It expanded
  its targets to include not just Wall Street, but the NYPDâ€”particularly over NYPD''s
  stop and frisk policy which harassed and abused hundreds of thousands of, mostly
  Black and Brown, people each year. On Friday, October 21st, a little more than a
  month after activists took over Zuccotti Park, protestors marched to the 28th precinct
  in Harlem. Among those arrested in the action was Cornel West. This protest sign
  reads "The NYPD Stops and Frisks hundreds of thousands of innocent people each year." '
