description: 'In response to the austerity measures put in place by the Spanish government,
  the 15-M, or Los Indignados, movement was formed. Los Indignados, with their slogan
  "no house, no job, no pension, no fear," fought against precarity in housing, healthcare,
  education, employment, and pensions. As a global movement, Occupy Wall Street not
  only blossomed across nearly every continent, but it sought and found inspiration
  in youth-led, self-organized resistance around the world, inclusive of the 15-M
  movement. Signs announcing, "Somos Los Indignandos," or "We Are Los Indignados‚Äù
  were common at Occupy Wall Street. '
