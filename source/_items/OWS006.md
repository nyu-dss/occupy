description: "As a horizontal and leaderful movement, Occupy Wall Street invited wide
  participation. Individuals often independently produced documentation on how to
  join the movement. This unattributed flyer, produced during the post-May Day \"Week
  of Actions Against Austerity,\" offers a flowchart to newcomers on how to join Occupy.
  While this flowchart suggests a wholly egalitarian movement—one could simply show
  up and \"Occupy Wall St. regulars will talk you through some workings of OWS, answer
  your questions, and help you plug into groups and projects”—the entrenchment of
  societal oppressions in Occupy was very real and was a barrier to participation
  for many. \n\n"

image_description: 'Black handwritten text is set on a white page. The reader is prompted
  by a question "How Can I get More Involved in Occupy?" and offers "3 things you
  can do next." The document takes on the form of a flowchart, providing information,
  inclusive of links to websites, for how to be involved in one of three ways: 1.
  Come to a weekly orientation, 2. Come to the week of Actions Against Austerity 3.
  Plug in online. '
