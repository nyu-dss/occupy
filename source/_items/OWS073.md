description: Daily schedules offered a snapshot of the various meetings taking place
  during the fall 2011. Schedules such as these would have been posted at the encampment's
  information desk. The atrium of 60 Wall Street was a public-private space, with
  chairs and free Wi-Fi, that was operated by Deutsche Bank. As an indoor space where
  the activists could gather, it was a frequent site for many smaller working group
  meetings.
