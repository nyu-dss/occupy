          <dd>*Content Warning: This caption includes description of the state sanctioned murder of Black individuals in the United States.* This flyer is for two protests in honor of Ramarley Graham that were held just before his funeral in the Bronx. Graham was killed by New York police officer, Richard Haste, who stormed into his grandmother's apartment and shot him in the chest on February 2, 2012. The flyer informs readers that Graham was unarmed, and that the police did not have a warrant to enter his family's home. Officers spotted Graham at a bodega near his home and thought he was carrying a gun because he adjusted his waistband. Officers reported that Graham ran to his grandmother's apartment after they talked to him, but surveillance footage showed that he slowly walked back to the residential building.</dd>
        
    
  
    

    
      
        <dt>Image Description</dt>
        
          <dd>This black and white, flyer is designed like a Wanted poster. An illustration of a faceless cop is outlined with a square. Above the illustration the flyer reads in all-capital letters: "Wanted—For The Murder Of Ramarley Graham—Officer Richard Haste Sergeant Scott Morris." Below the illustration, text in all capital letters states, "Speak Your Rage Against Police Violence." The flyer provides directions and notes that "Tuesday, February 14th is Ramarley's funeral" and offers background on his murder. Next to the directions is a handwritten note: "E. 229th and White Plains Road 2 train." Personal contact information has been redacted by the curators of the exhibit.</dd>
