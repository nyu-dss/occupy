          <dd>Daily Info signs kept activists broadly informed at Zuccotti. This sign attempts to communicate with activists in the immediate aftermath of the November 15th raid of the park by NYPD. In the early morning hours of November 15th, NYPD ruthlessly and violently evicted activists from the park, and approximately 200 people were arrested. That evening, following a judge's order to reopen the park, activists reclaimed the space albeit with police-enforced strict rules on noise, occupancy, and movement—all of which were meant to deter activists from gathering together. The sign informs activists at Zuccotti to "keep circling," or to keep marching around the park, as they were not permitted to rest their bodies on the pavement. It also notes that sleeping/shelter was relocated to Judson Memorial Church.</dd>
        
    
  
    

    
      
        <dt>Image Description</dt>
        
          <dd>A poster board created after Occupy was evicted says "Info" at the top and "Trying to recreate" in red. On either side of the word “Info” is "OWS." Below "Info" there are five dashes listing details. These details note that a judge ordered the park to reopen, that activists should "keep circling," and that housing for sleep has been arranged at Judson Memorial Church. Lastly, the sign says that people are also at 6th and Canal. The sign appears to have been hastily written. On the back side of the poster, there are notes that appear to be a case law citations. They read, "Articles 78, 30 and 63 Civil Practice Law and Rules 42 USC 1983 and 1988."</dd>
