          <dd>NYU4OWS was a group of NYU undergraduate and graduate students who came together in solidarity with Occupy Wall Street in October of 2011. According to their Facebook page, last updated in 2015, NYU4OWS "was founded to organize the NYU community around issues raised by Occupy Wall Street and to highlight the connections between NYU and Wall Street...Our organization is made up of students at NYU who believe our university should be an institution governed by students, faculty, staff and community members. We believe NYU should be a university that stands up and fights for human rights, including the right to education, housing and work with dignity." The group organized with students from CUNY, the New School, Columbia and other schools in the city to hold the All-City Student Assembly weekly in Washington Square Park; they held the People's U, a series of lectures by faculty, students, and activists to bring free political education to the public; they coordinated and led walk-outs and marches; and they produced literature such as this pamphlet. In this pamphlet, NYU4OWS uncovers the University's ties to Wall Street and calls upon students to join the OWS movement.</dd>
        
    
  
    

    
      
        <dt>Image Description</dt>
        
          <dd>This three-page pamphlet answers the question, “What does NYU have to do with Wall Street?” In black text on a white page, the pamphlet is broken down into four sections: 1. Corporate Greed Doesn't Stop on Wall Street: NYU's Board of Trustees, 2. Profiting from Student Debt: The Second Most Expensive School in the US, 3. NYU's Real Estate Empire, 4. Fighting Back: Labor and the Corporate University. On the back page, there is information for where to join a march on November 17th. Next to the information an image of the Wall Street Bull charging underneath the Washington Square Arch is crossed out. Next to this image is text that reads, "NYU: Cut the Bull!"</dd>
