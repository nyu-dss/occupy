          <dd>*Content Warning: This caption includes description of police brutality and sexual assault.* On the six month anniversary of Occupy, hundreds of protestors gathered in Zuccotti Park. Police abruptly declared the park closed at 11:30 PM, immediately moved into the park, and began brutalizing protestors with batons. Thought this flyer does not speak directly of her experience, it was during this six month anniversary gathering that Cecily McMillan was sexually assaulted, beaten, and arrested by NYPD. McMillian was ultimately charged with felony second-degree assault of a police officer. In a trial that was criticized as a miscarriage of justice, and became a rallying cry against the inequities of the justice system, McMillian was convicted of her charges, and was sentenced to three months in prison and five years of probation. She served fifty-eight days at Rikers Island. This flyer calls for an emergency response to the brutality that protestors faced on March 17, 2012. It is not only a document of the harrassment and violence that Occupy protestors faced at the hands of NYPD, but it demonstrates how fluidly, in a leaderful movement, protestors were able to organize themselves into action.</dd>

In the Courtyard, B-Level (entrance on Spruce Street). The flyer describes police brutality during the sixth month anniversary of Occupy and calls on "thousands from the millions that have been inspired and had their imagination captured by Occupy to stop the nationwide suppression."</dd>
