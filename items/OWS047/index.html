          <dd>This cardboard sign that reads "Wisconsin, Workers, Students, Thank You," references the protests against Act 10 at the Wisconsin State Capitol that occurred from February to June 2011. Introduced by Republican Governor Scott Walker, Act 10 placed severe limitations on collective bargaining rights for the state's public sector employees and made drastic cuts to their benefits. The law also made it illegal for employers to collect union dues from paychecks, even with a worker’s consent. Wisconsin’s public sector unions have lost about 70 percent of their members since 2011. Activists were able to initiate a recall election in 2012, but Walker defeated the Democratic nominee Tom Barrett. The Obama administration did little to support Wisconsin activists or Barrett's campaign in 2011-2012. Walker later signed a right-to-work law in 2015, further weakening the influence of unions in the state. The protests at the Capitol involved tens of thousands of people, and they garnered much attention in labor and left media throughout 2011. Public sector workers and other activists sought to link their struggle to a long history of bipartisan attacks on unions, particularly since the 1980s. The occupation of the Wisconsin State Capitol is now often seen as a precursor to Occupy Wall Street.</dd>
        
    
  
    

    
      
        <dt>Image Description</dt>
        
          <dd>A raised fist, drawn with yellow and black marker, and with the word "We" on the cuff of its shirtsleeve, is at the center of this cardboard sign. Surrounding the fist is text that reads "Wisconsin Workers, Educators, Students, an Artists Thank You! The word "Wisconsin" is outlined, and in the upper right-hand corner of the sign it reads, "Help Support Collective Bargaining, Help Us All!" Yellow duct tape covers each of the corners and two pieces of black duct tape are folded over the top edge. The backside of the sign shows that it is a cardboard box from "Mutual Trading Co, Inc. New York."</dd>
